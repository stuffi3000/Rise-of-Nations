    # To truly match the Ukrainian tree's size, you'd need to:
    # 1. Flesh out each of the 4 main political paths with 5-10 subsequent focuses detailing domestic policy, foreign policy aims, and unique military/economic aspects.
    # 2. Each of those might have 1-2 mutually exclusive choices within them.
    # 3. The generic Army/Navy/Air/Industry trees would also need to be much longer, with more specific tech bonuses, factory outputs, national spirits, and possibly choices within them (e.g., light vs medium tanks, different industrial focuses).
    # 4. Add focuses for research slots (typically 2-3 in a full tree).
    # 5. Add more "flavor" focuses that grant PP, stability, or trigger interesting events.
    # 6. The "Anarchist" branch of Ukraine's communist tree has 7 focuses alone. The "Second Republic" branch has another 10+. Each main political path in Ukraine's tree spawns ~20-30 focuses.
    # This example provides the foundational structure and thematic adaptation for Hawaii.
    # Scaling it to ~100 focuses would involve repeating this detailed branching process for all major paths.
