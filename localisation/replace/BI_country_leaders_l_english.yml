 #Austria-Hungary
 POLITICS_FRANZ_JOSEPH_DESC:0 "Franz Joseph looms large in the historical consciousness of posterity. a symbol of the Monarchy who was beyond criticism. Even today, Franz Joseph is regarded as the very epitome of the emperor in the successor states of the Monarchy. His personality developed in unique and difficult circumstances: from his earliest youth it was impressed up on him that he had been chosen as emperor, an office that was to be served with humility. His mental isolation was reinforced by court ceremonial, which elevated his imperial majesty to an almost religious level. Franz Joseph was wholly imbued with the concept of his divine mission as emperor. In December 1848, Franz Joseph's uncle Emperor Ferdinand abdicated the throne at Olomouc, as part of Minister President Felix zu Schwarzenberg's plan to end the Revolutions of 1848 in Hungary. Franz Joseph then acceded to the throne. Largely considered to be a reactionary, he spent his early reign resisting constitutionalism in his domains. The Austrian Empire was forced to cede its influence over Tuscany and most of its claim to Lombardy–Venetia to the Kingdom of Sardinia, following the Second Italian War of Independence in 1859 and the Third Italian War of Independence in 1866. Franz Joseph is troubled by nationalism during his entire reign. He concluded the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, which granted greater autonomy to Hungary and transformed the Austrian Empire into the Dual Monarchy of Austria-Hungary. He rules peacefully for now, but personally suffered the tragedies of the execution of his brother Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico in 1867, the suicide of his son Crown Prince Rudolf in 1889 and the assassination of his wife Empress Elisabeth in 1898. Yet even after all this he is known to many as a person of integrity and decency, Franz Joseph is variously described by people around him as stoic or even unfeeling in his reaction to the numerous political and military defeats he suffered as ruler, which he took as personal setbacks."

The Victorian Era is currently a period of industrial, political, scientific, and military change within the United Kingdom, and its marked by a great expansion of the British Empire. In 1876, the British Parliament voted to grant her the additional title of Empress of India. Her mother was extremely protective, and Victoria was raised largely isolated from other children under the so-called 'Kensington System', an elaborate set of rules and protocols devised by the Duchess and her ambitious and domineering comptroller, Sir John Conroy, who was rumoured to be the Duchess's lover. Victoria married her first cousin Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha in 1840. Their children married into royal and noble families across the continent, earning Victoria the sobriquet 'The Grandmother of Europe' and spreading haemophilia in European royalty. Albert became an important political adviser as well as the Queen's companion, replacing Viscount Melbourne as the dominant influential figure in the first half of her life. Victoria's mother was evicted from the palace, to Ingestre House in Belgrave Square. After the death of Victoria's aunt, Princess Augusta, in 1840, Victoria's mother was given both Clarence and Frogmore Houses. Through Albert's mediation, relations between mother and daughter slowly improved. After Albert's death in 1861, Victoria plunged into deep mourning and avoided public appearances. As a result of her seclusion, republicanism in the United Kingdom temporarily gained strength, but in the latter half of her reign, her popularity recovered.

Sergei Witte, Russia's finance minister, saw things differently and suggested to the Tsar that Nicholas be appointed to the Siberian Railway Committee. Alexander III argued that Nicholas was not mature enough to take on serious responsibilities, to which Witte replied that if Nicholas was not introduced to state affairs, he would never be ready to understand them. Alexander's assumptions that he would live a long life and had years to prepare Nicholas for becoming Tsar proved wrong, as by 1894, Alexander's health was failing. On 26 May 1896, Nicholas's formal coronation as Tsar was held in Uspensky Cathedral located within the Kremlin. Nicholas always believed God chose him to be the tsar and therefore the decisions of the tsar reflected the will of God and could not be disputed. He was convinced that the simple people of Russia understood this and loved him, as demonstrated by the display of affection he perceived when he made public appearances. His old-fashioned belief made for a very stubborn ruler who rejected constitutional limitations on his power. It put the tsar at variance with the emerging political consensus among the Russian elite."

 POLITICS_CNA_DESC:0 "The Consejo Nacional de Administración (National Council of Administration) was part of the executive power in Uruguay between 1919 and 1933, ruling alongside the President of the Republic. The colegiado system was proposed by President José Batlle y Ordóñez during his second term in office, with the aim of creating an executive body similar to the Swiss Federal Council. Batlle had been opposed to the presidential system, believing that a collegiate body would lower the risk of a dictatorship emerging. Although the proposal was unsuccessful in 1916, Batlle negotiated a compromise with the National Party to include the system in a new constitution approved in a 1917 referendum. The compromise provided for a president and a nine-member National Council of Administration, which consisted of six members of the winning party and also three from the runner-up party. The president was responsible for foreign affairs, national security and agriculture, whilst the CNA oversaw the budget, education, healthcare, industry, industrial relations, labour, livestock and public works."

 POLITICS_WILLIAM_MCKINLEY_DESC:0 "Serving as the 25th President since March 4th of 1897, He was president during the Spanish–American War of 1898, raised protective tariffs to boost American industry, and rejected the expansionary monetary policy of free silver, keeping the nation on the gold standard. A Republican, McKinley is the last president to have served in the American Civil War; he was the only one to begin his service as an enlisted man, and end as a brevet major. After the war, he settled in Canton, Ohio, where he practiced law and married Ida Saxton. In 1876, McKinley was elected to Congress, where he became the Republican Party's expert on the protective tariff, which he promised would bring prosperity. His 1890 McKinley Tariff was highly controversial and, together with a Democratic redistricting aimed at gerrymandering him out of office, led to his defeat in the Democratic landslide of 1890. He was elected governor of Ohio in 1891 and 1893, steering a moderate course between capital and labor interests."
