In spite of that, Argentina has managed to keep its position among the top 15 economies in the world. With the crisis reaching it's end, it's time we regain the momentum we lost back on 1929. We'll have every minister bring forth their 'boxed up' projects and get ready to present them to the congress."

 ra_ram_ft_mp_desc:0 "People are a country’s most valuable resource. For half a century Argentina has been like a beacon, guiding migrants from everywhere in the world to its lands. Our population grows at rates unheard of for any other country in the continent. While the advantages of the "migrant wave" are obvious, many worry it could end up drowning us."
 ra_ram_ft_mp_sp:0 "Settling Priorities"
 ra_ram_ft_mp_sp_desc:0 "Argentina is large but scarcely populated save for the major urban centers.

 ra_ram_ft_ep_pi:0 "Private Institutions"
 ra_ram_ft_ep_pi_desc:0 "Private Institutions are expensive, but provide better education at no cost for the State. Some may argue that it segregates our children and we’ll have no way to control what is taught in their classrooms; it’s for us to decide if the benefits outweigh the risks."

 ra_ram_ft_ecp_drp_desc:0 "The Roca-Runciman pact was signed in order to ensure our trade with the British held strong after the Great Depression, yet the kneejerk reaction harmed our economy more than helped it. Crippling limits were imposed on our meat exports while Britain interests were granted unfair privileges that have hampered local industries, giving them a monopoly of the market."
 ra_ram_ft_ecp_pdm:0 "Prioritize Domestic Market"
 ra_ram_ft_ecp_pdm_desc:0 "If the British take our produce, then that just means we’ll have to save it for ourselves. It’ll only further our goals of becoming a properly industrialized country."

 ra_ram_ft_ecp_snm:0 "Seek New Markets"
 ra_ram_ft_ecp_snm_desc:0 "Now the constraints of the Roca-Runciman pact are gone we can explore new markets. Germany, the Soviet Union and Japan are great candidates. If we want our trade missions to succeed though, we better make sure we are in good standing with them before sending our delegations."
 ra_ram_ft_ecp_snm_tt: "\nYou'll be able to send one trade mission at a time. It'll take about a month to receive a response. Plan ahead, if you are refused it'll take a full year before you can negotiate with the same client again. A mission to England will also be available if you didn't sign the Eden-Malbran Pact."

 ra_ram_ft_ecp_eypf_desc:0 "Yacimientos Petrolíferos Federales was created in 1922 and became the first entirely state-run oil company in the world, making us pioneers in this area. Now it’s more than a decade later and we still have a long way to go on the road to self-sufficiency. Plans have been drawn up for a new building where we’ll be able to centralize the company’s administration and ensure it runs as smoothly as possible."
 ra_ram_ft_ecp_eypf_tt:0 "\nOnce the new YPF building is finished you'll get access to yearly events that will let you choose between bonuses for increasing refinery construction speed, local supplies or local resources."

 ra_ram_ft_ecp_fm_desc:0 "Coronel Manuel Savio, one of the best engineers in our Army, has brought forth a project to build up our heavy industry. Fabricaciones Militares will focus on producing equipment for our armed forces while also satisfying the demand for chemical products in the civilian sector.

 ra_ram_ft_ecp_ahz_desc:0 "If we want to expand our mining operations on the Zapla Forest any further we'll need energy to power all the machinery. The General Board of Fabricaciones Militares is ready to oversee the project, which is already attracting workers and specialists to Jujuy in droves."
 ra_ram_ft_ecp_ahz_tt:0 "\nOnce the foundry is built you'll get 2 infrastructure, 16 steel and 2 extra building slots in Tucuman as well as a 30% bonus to industrial research. You'll also get access to a repeatable event which will allow you to increase the Zapla Mine's production."
 ra_ram_ft_ecp_somisa:0 "SOMISA"
 ra_ram_ft_ecp_somisa_desc:0 "Savio knows that the more we develop our heavy industry the more it'll hunger for steel. Now that the Zapla Foundry and mining site are operational they can provide us the necessary raw materials to enact the National Metallurgy Plan. SOMISA (Sociedad Mixta Siderurgica Argentina) will centralize our steel production industry, bringing it to new heights."
 ra_ram_ft_ecp_somisa_tt:0 "\nOnce the SOMISA plant is fininshed you'll get +45 steel and 4 extra building slots in Santa Fe as well as a 30% research bonus to industry."
 ra_ram_ft_ecp_psc:0 "Private Sector Companies"
 ra_ram_ft_ecp_psc_desc:0 "Abandoning the private sector to its own luck would be a mistake. Not only would we lose industrial capacity but also foment unemployment. We must find a way to bring them afloat once more."
 ra_ram_ft_ecp_ti:0 "Tax Incentives"
 ra_ram_ft_ecp_ti_desc:0 "The easiest way to help the private sector is to make it cheaper for them to operate. It’ll cost us, but we’ll reap the benefits in the long term."
 ra_ram_ft_ecp_ei:0 "Electronics Industry"
 ra_ram_ft_ecp_ei_desc:0 "Electronic Engineering is a new brand of technology with which our country has little experience. If we want to catch up with this rapidly evolving new branch of science we need to make sure experts and companies with experience in the field feel welcome in Argentina."

 ra_ram_ft_ecp_sm:0 "Synthethic Materials"
 ra_ram_ft_ecp_sm_desc:0 "Our industry can build substitutes for pretty much anything, but only if it has the materials required. Even in a country as large as ours, there are things we simply do not have or can't afford to exploit. Our chemist will find ways to replace these."

 ra_ram_ft_ecp_ph:0 "Public Health"
 ra_ram_ft_ecp_ph_desc:0 "Health Care can be cripplingly expensive, especially for families with lower incomes. Our government can assume the responsibility of building and equipping public hospitals where people can get diagnosed and treated."

 ra_ram_ft_ecp_c_desc:0 "Hospitals are just buildings, we can construct hundreds of them yet unless we fill them with the necessary equipment and professional staff they will be of little use. The next step in our Public Health system is deciding just how much of a budget we'll assign to it."

 ra_ram_ft_pw_emo_rt:0 "Rio Turbio"

 ra_ram_ft_ahq_tgw_desc:0 "Perhaps the most devastating conflict in human history, the war to end all wars cost the lives of more than seventeen million people in the short span of four years.

 ra_ram_ft_ahq_tscw_desc:0 "A civil war is one of the worst things that can happen to a country. More so if outside powers use the opportunity to push their own agendas at the cost of civilian lives. While tragic, the Spanish War showed the advantages of air support and naval blockades."

 ra_ram_ft_ahq_tbk_desc:0 "Diametrically opposed to the Great War doctrines, the Blitzkrieg seeks to overwhelm enemies with speed and envelopment maneuvers while relying heavily on air support to weaken enemy defenses. The use of radios to keep all forces coordinated is key for this to succeed."

 ra_ram_ft_ahq_ars:0 "Armored Support"

 ra_ram_ft_ahq_bfc:0 "Battlefield Communications"

Precise artillery strikes, air support literally ‘on the fly’, coordinating tank columns across a raging battlefield, radio allows us to wring out the best out of our forces and helps them stay on the initiative."
 ra_ram_ft_ahq_am:0 "Army Mechanization"

 ra_ram_ft_nhq_sd_desc:0 "Argentina’s experience with submarines is limited. Our first units were built in Taranto by the Italians and delivered only a few years ago. Captain Poch, the man in charge of our submarine fleet, has told us that the Cavallinis, called Tarantinos by our men, have performed remarkably well and has requested more units. We could buy more from the Italians... or build our own."
 ra_ram_ft_nhq_cd:0 "Cruiser Designs"
 ra_ram_ft_nhq_cd_desc:0 "The smaller version of the “Trentos” we bought from the Italians a few years ago have been great additions to the fleet.

A treaty was signed in 1889 in which we implicitly resigned our rights in exchange for lands on the Atacama Puna, lands the Bolivians didn’t even control as they had lost them during their war with Chile. Tarija remains historically and rightfully Argentinian."
 ra_ram_ft_fap_ce:0 "Chilean Encroachment"
 ra_ram_ft_fap_ce_desc:0 "In 1881 we agreed with Chile that our borders on the Andres follow the imaginary line set by the highest peaks and watersheds.

 rapworks.6.t:0 "The Rio Turbio Coal Mine"
 rapworks.6.da:0 "Expanding Rio turbio has been a difficult task. The mine's isolation, the grim history surrounding it (mass executions took place there on the 1920's), the weather, lack of infrastructure, among many other things make the endeavor a risky one. Phase one has seen the first dig site operational but the costs are too high with most of the yield being used in transportation alone. Phase two will see a railway built so we cut costs and reduce the time it takes for the coal to reach our industry."
 rapworks.6.db:0 "Construction has finished on the second dig site of Rio Turbio along with a new railway leading from the mine to it's shipping port on Rio Gallegos. A third dig site is planned and the YCF suggests we expand the port on Rio Gallegos as it's infrastructure is not capable of handling the kind of activity it's being put through, much less once the third site becomes operational."
 rapworks.6.dc:0 "With the third dig site and the improvements to the Rio Gallegos port complete, we can consider the Rio Turbio project complete. Further improvements will require more long term investments, as the location of the mine makes the amount of resources we can pour into it limited."
 rapworks.6.a:0 "Continue on to Phase 2."
 rapworks.6.b:0 "Continue on to Phase 3."

His wife, Emma Fernandez de Rodriguez, survives him though the General did not have any offspring to carry on his legacy."

 ramigration.1.d:0 "Argentina is large but scarceley populated. Our population has grown exponentially in the last decades, yet there are still vast swaths of our territory were we have little or no presence. The time has come to decide where our people can do the most good."
 ramigration.1.a:0 "Encourage urban migration"
 ramigration.1.a_tt:0 "\nSpreading out our population only weakens our industrial efforts, forcing us to commit resources to accommodate small communities that will take decades to bear fruit. People should stick to the major cities, where they’ll be both happier and more productive."
 ramigration.1.b:0 "Populate the countryside"
 ramigration.1.b_tt:0 "\nFor decades our policy has been to encourage migrants to settle in the countryside. Overcrowding could negatively affect our cities in more ways than one. The Great Depression dented our agricultural industry but that doesn’t mean we should abandon it all together."

 ramigration.3.d:0 "The 'American Dream' is not exclusive to our cousins in the north. Millions of people chose Argentina over the United States to start anew. In order to keep the flow going, we must make sure they know our doors are open and that there's work to be had in our country."

 ramigration.3.a_tt:0 "\nMost of our neighbors share history, culture and language with us. Integrating them into our society should be easy.

Argentina might have a history of political unrest, but is nonetheless a peaceful country. Welcoming refugees will tax us… but never break us.

Opinions are evenly split between those who think the Treaty could become a hindrace to our own goals and those who think it's an extra layer of protection against an increasingly dangerous world. Article 17 of the treaty states any party wishing to withdraw must give a year notice... a lot can happen in that time though."

We are being forced to wade through mediators, reconciliation comittees and all sorts of interference. This is giving our enemies more time to prepare and forcing us to work extra hard to get public opinion in our side. We could withdraw from the Treaty, but protocol states a one year notice before we are allowed to. We could also denounce it, yet the political backlash from other signataries could be severe."

This unabated interest has seen wide coverage on local newspapers and radio stations, with lengthy articles and interviews exploring all kinds of scenarios, from political to bellical solutions.\n\nWhile radicalization may work in the government’s advantage in the long run, there’s no doubt that our neighbors will take notice of this."

While many remain unconvinced, the President's message appears to have reached that sector of the general public which hopes for an end to the institutional violence that has plagued argentinian politics in the past years."

Lured by aeronautics, Arteaga moved to Paris in 1916 so he could study that new technology first hand. He joined the Superior School of Aeronautics and Mechanical Construction of Paris, graduating as aeronautical engineer in 1918 and becoming the first Argentinian with that specialty. Arteaga remained in Europe for two more years, learning as much as he can. He returned to Argentina in 1922, filled with theoretical and practical knowledge. In 1925 he presented his proyect for an Airplane Factory in Argentinian soil, which was quickly approved and put into motion. The FMA opened it's doors on 1927, less than a year later Argentina had already built it's first Biplane Avro K-504 'Gosport'.
