Now that the Rio Santiago Dockyard and the Azul Ordinance Factory are completed, we can reorganize our entire ship building industry into a huge complex equipped with the best technology available to us.\n\nAFNE will be the birthplace of a completely new Argentinian Navy, one that will not need to fear the wims of foreign powers nor their fleets."

 arg_nm_BNMdP_desc:0 "On 1926, art. 2 of Law 11.378 authorized the acquisition of two submarine groups and determined the need to create docks, workshops and all the necessary infrastructure to accomodate the new units. Mar del Plata was chosen as the main base of operations, construction beginning a year later.\n\nWhile only one group of three submarines was eventually built, the Italian made Cavallini class vessels - called 'Tarantinos' by the men - entered service in 1933 and have called Mar del Plata home ever since."
