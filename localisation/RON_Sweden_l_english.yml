news.906.t:0"Sweden revokes the Åland Convention!"
news.906.d:0"The Åland Convention was signed in 1921 where Sweden and Finland agreed to let the Islands remain within Finnish sovereignty with a large degree of Autonomy. Furthermore the demilitarization of the territory was essential if it should pass in the League of Nations. The Swedes have now decided to reclaim Åland as part of their territory. Given the large Swedish population on the Islands this is hardly surprising,  many Generals and Politicians have pushed for this since the Convention was signed. Since the Convention was one of the first rulings by League of Nations, Sweden's position in the organization might be challenged."
