 better_canada.1.t:0 "[CAN.GetNameDef] Demands Alaska"
 better_canada.1.d:0 "[CAN.GetNameDef] has demanded that we immediately cede Alaska to them. They cite that it is an affront to have a foreign military so deep within their lands, being a direct insult to their sovereignty."
 better_canada.2.t:0 "[CAN.GetNameDef] considers us an ally and a friend"
 better_canada.2.d:0 "[CAN.GetNameDef] will be founding their own faction it seems and is already in talks of inviting us potentially. While not formally inviting us yet, they are giving us a courtesy notice to consider the possibility of a future together." 
 better_canada.2.a:0 "We'll consider it"
 better_canada.3.t:0 "[CAN.GetNameDef] founds the 'North American League'"
 better_canada.3.d:0 "[CAN.GetNameDef], having grown tired of the politics of Europe, has founded the 'North American League'. Their goals are officially stated as maintaining the status quo on their continent, but not everyone fully trusts this statement. There are even rumours that [USA.GetNameDef] may even be considering joining this faction."
 better_canada.3.a:0 "Interesting"
 better_canada.3.b:0 "Greatness Awaits"
 better_canada.4.t:0 "A Plebiscite is Held"
 better_canada.4.d:0 "The results are in. Every territory and province, except Quebéc, votes in large majority for the expansion of conscription rules. The troublesome aspect is that not only did Quebéc vote no, they voted nearly 73% against it. It is very likely that things will not change in Quebec in terms of conscription. Perhaps in light of what their peers have said they will change their minds, even if just a little. Of course we could be more forceful instead."
 better_canada.4.a:0 "What a bother..."
 better_canada.5.t:0 "Newfoundland defies [ENG.GetNameDef]"
 better_canada.5.d:0 "It would seem that the local garrisons of Newfoundland were extremely shocked at [ENG.GetNameDef] refusing the results of the referendum of the locals. When an angry mob approached the bases instead of fighting they instead were told to stand down by local officers, citing that it should be the will of the people to decide their own fate. As a result the garrisons were allowed to leave safely and forthright Newfoundland and Labrador belong to us."
 better_canada.5.a:0 "Just as planned"
 better_canada.6.d:0 "Earlier this morning locals of Newfoundland and Labrador were incited to a mob and marched onto the various garrison bases demanding their independence from [ENG.GetName]. The officers, fearing a senseless bloodshed, gave in to their demands and the [ENG.GetNameDef] troops were allowed to leave peacefully. There are already whispers that this was far too coordinated to have simply have been a 'random' set of mobs and accusations have been already levied towards [CAN.GetName] as being the likely culprit."
 better_canada.7.t:0 "Adrien Arcand unites the Fascists"
 better_canada.7.d:0 "Earlier today the various fascist parties of Canada held a national convention in Kingston, Ontario. There it was decided to unite all of the parties into one new party led by a particularily charismatic person called 'Adrien Arcand'. As his first action of this newly unified party Arcand held a rally at Massey Hall to promote the party. Referring himself as the 'Canadian führer' it seems he seeks to emulate the Nazi party."
 better_canada.9.t:0 "The civil war is over"
 better_canada.9.d:0 "For better or worse, the civil war is over. Only time will tell what will happen as a result of it."
 better_canada.10.t:0 "Quebéc is no longer ours"
 better_canada.10.d:0 "As a result of losing Quebéc we obviously are no longer affected by their refusal to follow conscription laws." 
 better_canada.11.t:0 "The Quebécois reaffirm their stance"
 better_canada.11.d:0 "The Quebécois remind us that they will continue to support Canada no matter what." 
 better_canada.12.t:0 "[QUE.GetName] invites [USA.GetNameDef] to the Continental Alliance"
 better_canada.12.d:0 "[QUE.GetName] has noticed that were have not alligned ourselves to any faction and requested that we form a faction with them. They cite that it'd be in both of our best interests to do so since we are neighbours." 
 better_canada.12.a:0 "Sounds good"
 better_canada.13.t:0 "[QUE.GetName] claims the East Coast"
 better_canada.13.d:0 "[QUE.GetName] has issued a statement demanding that the UK and Canada cede the east coast to them, citing the Francophone population's demands to be a part of Quebéc. Already they are posturing on the borders seemingly ready to take it by force if needed."
 better_canada.14.t:0 "[QUE.GetName] claims the French Louisiana"
 better_canada.14.d:0 "[QUE.GetName] has issued a surprising statement demanding that [USA.GetNameDef] cede what was once considered a part of French Louisiana. Already they are posturing on the borders seemingly ready to take it by force if needed."
 better_canada.15.t:0 "[QUE.GetName] revives the Continental Alliance"
 better_canada.15.d:0 "Earlier today [QUE.GetNameDef] issued a statement declaring the revival of the "Continental Alliance of 1775". They are now looking for allies to join this alliance, although it is unclear what exactly their goals are."
 better_canada.16.t:0 "[QUE.GetNameDef] takes Paris"
 better_canada.16.d:0 "Earlier today [QUE.GetNameDef], in a case of what one could call 'reverse colonlialism', has ironically conquered the French capital of Paris. Quebécois troops march along the streets in pride. Already [QUE.GetLeader] is calling for this to be a national holiday from this day forward."
 better_canada.20.d:0 "[CAN.GetNameDef] has demanded that we immediately cede Newfoundland and Labrador to them. They cite that it is an affront to have a foreign military so deep within their lands, being a direct insult to their sovereignty."

 better_canada.20.a:0 "Very Well"
 better_canada.20.b:0 "Absolutely Not!"
 better_canada.21.t:0 "Consider the options"
 better_canada.21.d:0 "Before doing anything we must decide how we approach this. We could just outright demand the land in question however there is a probably better route. The people of Labrador would most likely vote in our favor in a referendum making it much more likely for them to accept. Of course, they can still deny afterwards but it would give our cause much more credence if they were to do so."
 better_canada.21.a:0 "Hold the referendum"
 better_canada.21.b:0 "We need no referendum"
 better_canada.22.t:0 "The Newfoundland Referendum"
 better_canada.22.d:0 "It would seem that [CAN.GetNameDef] has encouraged the population of Newfoundland and Labrador to hold a referendum. They have overwhelmingly agreed that they would like to join Canada as one nation rather than stay under our rule. We could of course deny them this but it would give reason for a war if we do."
 better_canada.22.a:0 "We mustn't deny their will"
 better_canada.22.b:0 "Now is not the time for this"
 better_canada.23.t:0 "The Newfoundland Referendum"
 better_canada.23.d:0 "Earlier today the people of Newfoundland held a referendum and overwhelmingly agreed on requesting [ENG.GetNameDef] to release them to join Canada.

 better_canada.24.t:0 "The Newfoundland Referendum"
 better_canada.24.d:0 "Earlier today the people of Newfoundland held a referendum and overwhelmingly agreed on requesting [ENG.GetNameDef] to release them to join Canada. [ENG.GetLeader] refused this referendum citing that they never approved of holding such a referendum in the first place and citing it as illegal. [CAN.GetLeader] is outraged by this news and vows to liberate the lands."
 better_canada.24.a:0 "Interesting"

 better_canada.30.d:0 "Earlier today [CAN.GetNameDef] demanded [USA.GetNameDef] cede Alaska to them, citing an unfair military presence as a direct insult to their sovereignty. In a surprising turn of events [USA.GetLeader] agreed and allowed the Canadians to take the state peacefully."

 better_canada.43.t:0 "They were convinced"
 better_canada.43.d:0 "The population was moved to reluctantly agree to some measure of conscription. While still lower than other provinces this should give us much more room to breathe now."
 better_canada.43.a:0 "This will help"

 better_canada.46.a:0 "This could be bad..."  
 better_canada.47.d:0 "It would seem your demands on the Québecois eventually turned into a seperatist notion. They have cut all access to the province and are declaring themselves an independent nation."
 better_canada.47.a:0 "This is bad..."
 better_canada.47.b:0 "Vive le Québec libre!"
 better_canada.48.t:0 "[QUE.GetName] secedes from [CAN.GetNameDef]"
 better_canada.48.d:0 "In an attempt to enforce conscription upon the local French populace in [CAN.GetNameDef] [CAN.GetLeader] seems to have only enraged the population in Québec instead. They have seceded from [CAN.GetNameDef] effective immediately. [CAN.GetLeader] has already called for action against this illegal move by [QUE.GetLeader]."

 better_canada.50.d:0 "Imperial Oil Ltd had spent years leading up to and during the war drilling unsuccessfully for oil. Their luck changed however earlier today.

 better_canada.51.t:0 "Tungsten Discovery in Northwestern Canada"
 better_canada.51.d:0 "Prior to the war the exploration and development of tungsten mines was a very limited affair, generally done as a side effect of other things. More recently however we had expanded and promoted endeavours to find the rare metal in British Columbia and surrounding areas as they've always had some amounts of Tungsten. Today we finally had some success and found a fairly large reserve of it in 'Red Rose'; far in the north-west of the country."
 better_canada.51.a:0 "This will certainly help the war"
 better_canada.52.t:0 "Artificial Rubber Made in Sarnia, Ontario"
 better_canada.52.d:0 "Up until now we have heavily relied on natural rubber imported from south-east Asia. With the the nature of war however we cannot rely on that source anymore as we it may get cut-off by convoy raids. As a result Polymer Corp. had been looking into possible alternatives and finally had a breakthrough. They found the means to make something they call 'synthetic rubber'. Already it is being made in Sarnia but we should promote this research further and expand the industry."
 better_canada.52.a:0 "Excellent"
 better_canada.53.t:0 "The Question of Governance"
 better_canada.53.d:0 "Now that we've broken free we must re-organize our government. We could keep the nationalist momentum going and embrace Fascism, or we could let the people decide what to do moving forward."

They served until the beginning of World War II when they were mostly used for secondary and training duties."
 QUE_submarine_2:0 "T Class"
 QUE_submarine_2_desc:0 "The T-class or Triton-class boats were designed to replace the O, P, and R class large submarines. They were moderately large submarines with long range well-suited for the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean.

They were the ultimate evolution of British destroyer design during the First World War, embodying the improvements of their predecessors as well as new technological advances. Large numbers of these ships were built during the late stages of WWI and became the backbone of the Royal Navy's destroyer flotillas afterwards. Beginning in the 1930s, they were placed into reserve fleets, used eventually relegated to convoy escort duties. They were adequately-armed, fast vessels with good range."

 QUE_destroyer_4:0 "Algonquin Class"
 QUE_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Algonquin class was the Canadian designation for British Battle-class destroyers. The ships were ordered as part of the 1942 and 1943 Naval Programs.

Their late introduction to the war led to a minimal contribution."
 QUE_light_cruiser_1:0 "C Class"
 QUE_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "C-class light cruisers were a group of twenty-eight light cruisers of the Royal Navy. They were built before and during the First World War for the rough conditions of the North Sea. They proved to be rugged and capable vessels despite being somewhat small and cramped. Their armament was more than satisfactory, as they carried enough 6 in. guns to fight enemy surface targets and a heavy torpedo load to finish off enemy vessels and convoys. They saw extensive use during WWI and participated in many surface actions. Only a limited number of the vessels survived the scrap head to WWI. Only the Caledon, Ceres, and Carlisle subclasses were in service by the mid 1930's."
 QUE_light_cruiser_2:0 "Southampton Class"
 QUE_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Southampton-class light cruisers were a subclass of the Town-class cruisers and were designed to counter the Japanese Mogami-class cruisers.

They were the basis for many of the subsequent RN wartime light cruiser designs."
 QUE_light_cruiser_3:0 "Quebec Class"
 QUE_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Quebec class was the Canadian designation for British Crown Colony-class light cruisers. These were improved versions of the earlier Town class but with a simplified design to speed up construction and reduce costs. The ships carried the same guns as their predecessors, four triple turrets housing 6 in. guns. They were similarly armored but because of their smaller engines, their range were somewhat reduced. The type included two subclasses - Fiji and Ceylon."
 QUE_light_cruiser_4:0 "Ontario Class"
 QUE_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Ontario class was the Canadian designation for British Minotaur-class (or Swiftsure-class) light cruisers. These cruisers were designed as a modified version of the Crown Colony class, incorporating war modifications that were authorized in 1941.

Altogether, five ships were commissioned but only four were active at the start of WWII."
 QUE_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Surrey Class"
 QUE_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Surrey-class heavy cruisers were proposed under the 1928 Naval Program. They were improved versions of the earlier York-class heavy cruisers. Had they been completed, they would have been equipped with four twin 8 in. gun turrets, heavier armor, and more powerful engines. Two ships were ordered but none were laid down."
 QUE_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Admiral Class"
 QUE_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Admiral-class heavy cruisers (not to be confused with the Admiral-class battlecruisers) were the Royal Navy's last attempt to design and build cruisers armed with 8 in. guns. Design studies started in 1938 and ended in 1941, resulting in various proposals. The final proposals featured new 8 in. guns in triple turrets, a heavy AA armament, thick armor, and good speed. A lack of enemy cruisers and the cost efficiency of these vessels resulted in a focus on building more light cruisers instead."
 QUE_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Churchill Design"
 QUE_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "These ships were proposed by Sir Winston Churchill, Lord of the Admirality, in the early stages of WWII to counter the German Deutschland class big gun cruisers. These vessels would have had 9.2 in. cannons, heavy AA, and strong armor. They were designed to effectively battle the enemy capital ships. The ships were eventually cancelled because of high costs and a lack of demand for a new heavy cruiser. "
 QUE_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Renown Class"
 QUE_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Renown-class battlecruisers were originally laid down as improved versions of the Revenge-class battleships. Their construction was suspended at the outbreak of WWI. Admiral Lord Fisher managed to restart their construction as battlecruisers. These ships were the quintessential battlecruiser. They were well-armed, fast, and maneuverable, but had thinner armor and a shorter operational range. Only two of the original three ships, Repulse and Renown, were completed."
 QUE_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Princess Royal Class"
 QUE_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Princess Royal was a class of hypothetical battlecruisers that were a faster and cheaper version of the King George V-class battleships. These vessels carried a similar but reduced armament for both surface and anti-air combat: two triple 14 in. cannons and six twin 5.25 in. AA guns. Their fast speed and long range would provide the Royal Navy quick strike capabilities and convoy protection, but their limited armor would prove problematic if they had to fight modern battleships."
 QUE_battleship_1:0 "Queen Elizabeth Class"
 QUE_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Queen Elizabeth-class battleships were ordered under the 1912 Naval Program. These ships were the first to be equipped with 15 in. guns, and were considered the first fast battleships. They carried heavy armament for both primary and secondary roles and their thick armor made these vessels excellent warships, ideal for protecting the vast British Empire. Six ships were ordered but only five were commissioned and later modernized prior to WWII."
 QUE_battleship_2:0 "King George V Class"
 QUE_battleship_2_desc:0 "The King George V-class battleships were the result of the 1922 Washington and 1930 First London Naval Treaties which limited the maximum displacement and gunnery of capital ships. As such, these ships were equipped with smaller-caliber cannons than earlier and even contemporary battleships. Despite the smaller caliber, the ships were adequately armed, carried strong AA weaponry, and had adequate protection. Five ships were ordered and laid down as replacement for the old Queen Elizabeth Class battleships."
 QUE_battleship_3:0 "Lion Class"
 QUE_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Lion-class battleships were the follow-up class to King George V battleships, incorporating many of their features. Six ships were ordered in the 1938 Naval Program to replace the aging Revenge-class battleships but none were finished due to the erupting hostilities. The vessels would have been general similar to the King George-class, but the main armament would be heavier, introducing a new 16 in. cannon. They would also have thicker armor and more powerful engines."
 QUE_battleship_4:0 "Vanguard Class"
 QUE_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Vanguard-class battleship was the last battleship to be built for the Royal Navy. A single ship was ordered but four more were considered for the Pacific theater. Ordered under the 1940 Emergency War Program, construction did not gain a high priority and was finished after the war. The class had a sleek hull, which gave it an excellent stability and seaworthiness. The armament was the same as the Queen Elizabeth and Revenge class battleships, providing considerable firepower. Strong engines and good armor made the vessel fast and well protected."
 QUE_SH_battleship_1:0 "Centurion Class"
 QUE_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Centurion was a class of hypothetical heavy battleships of the Royal Navy built to counter the large vessels of the German and Japanese navies. Large 18 in. guns and thick armor provide the ship with the necessary firepower and protection to battle these vessels. Strong AA armament, long range, and good speed were a necessity to cover the vast seas of the British Empire."
 QUE_SH_battleship_2:0 "Lion II Class"
 QUE_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Lion II class battleships were designed in 1944 as an improved version of the earlier Lion-class battleship. Incorporating wartime lessons, this design was larger and heavier, and if completed, would carry either three or four triple 16 in. guns of the latest type. Thick armor plates protected the ship from any surface or aerial foe. The cost to build these ships, the defeat of enemy navies, and the need for aircraft carriers resulted in the abandonment of the project."
 QUE_carrier_1:0 "Courageous Class"
 QUE_carrier_1_desc:0 "These three aircraft carriers were converted battlecruisers and were the first fleet carriers of the Royal Navy. Their conversion was the result of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 and the work was finished in 1925. They were moderately-armored but well-armed vessels, with long range and good speed, but due to the nature of the conversion their aircraft complement was limited. Nonetheless, they gave the Royal Navy important experience in aircraft carrier construction and fleet air projection."
 QUE_carrier_2:0 "Ark Royal Class"
 QUE_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Ark Royal aircraft carrier was the first such vessel to be built to fit the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty. She was the first ship on which the hangars and flight deck were an integral part of the hull. Designed in 1934, the vessel was well-armored and armed. It carried a large complement of aircraft and had adequate operational range and speed to keep up with the major forces of the Royal Navy."
 QUE_carrier_3:0 "Illustrious Class"
 QUE_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Illustrious class was designed within the restrictions of the Second London Naval Treaty of 1936, which limited carrier size to an upper limit of 23,000 tons. She was the first British carrier to have an armored flight deck, which reduced its air group size. Heavy armor and AA weaponry provided a strong defense for the ships, while powerful engines and a large fuel store gave the ships long operational range."
 QUE_carrier_4:0 "Implacable Class"
 QUE_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Implacable-class aircraft carriers were ordered under the 1938 Naval Program and were essentially improved versions of the earlier Illustrious class. The war and the shift of priority to smaller vessels for convoy protection duties in the early and middle stages of the war slowed the constriction of these vessels. They were larger vessels able to carry more planes while maintaining thick armor on both the hull and flight deck. More powerful engines gave it greater speed and operational range compared to the Illustrious class."

 NEW_submarine_1:0 "L Class"
 NEW_submarine_1_desc:0 "The L-class were medium sized boats originally planned under the Emergency War Program as an improved version of the previous submarine classes. They were built in the late stages of World War I and were equipped with new, larger 21 in. torpedoes. They served until the beginning of World War II when they were mostly used for secondary and training duties."
 NEW_submarine_2:0 "T Class"
 NEW_submarine_2_desc:0 "The To-class or Triton-class boats were designed to replace the O, P, and R class large submarines. They were moderately large submarines with long range well-suited for the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. These boats were well-armed, stable platforms and were used extensively during the conflict, as 25 percent of the constructed boats were lost during the war."
 NEW_submarine_3:0 "U Class"
 NEW_submarine_3_desc:0 "The U class were small-sized submarines built under the War Emergency 1940 and 1941 Programs. Originally designed as training submarines as the war broke out, the design changed, allowing these submarines to prove useful in the confined waters of the North Sea and the Mediterranean. Due to their smaller size, their range and the weaponry were limited. Three subclasses made up the class: Undine, Umpire and Uproar."
 NEW_submarine_4:0 "V Class"
 NEW_submarine_4_desc:0 "The V-class or Vampire-class submarines were based on the previous U-class smaller sized boats. They were larger but still relatively small, with better seagoing ability but limited operational range and weaponry."
 NEW_destroyer_1:0 "V/W Class"
 NEW_destroyer_1_desc:0 "These destroyers included the Admirality and Thornycroft V and W classes. They were built under the War Emergency Program. They were the ultimate evolution of British destroyer design during the First World War, embodying the improvements of their predecessors as well as new technological advances. Large numbers of these ships were built during the late stages of WWI and became the backbone of the Royal Navy's destroyer flotillas afterwards. Beginning in the 1930s, they were placed into reserve fleets, used eventually relegated to convoy escort duties. They were adequately-armed, fast vessels with good range."
 NEW_destroyer_2:0 "G/H/I Class"
 NEW_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The G, H, and I class destroyers were ordered as part of the 1933 and 1934 Naval Construction Programs. They were generally repeats of the preceding F class, with a slight reduction in size. Armament in the G and H classes is the same as in the F class, with both using the 4.7 in. guns. These ships had long range, were adequately armed, and had a strong torpedo complement. They were used extensively during the war and suffered numerous losses."
 NEW_destroyer_3:0 "J/K/N Class"
 NEW_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The J, K, and N classes were similar to the earlier Tribal class but rather than emphasizing gun armament, the designers returned to a more standard heavy torpedo and lighter gun setup. The ships were modified throughout their wartime service. Upgrades included improved anti-aircraft guns and radar. They were fast, long-ranged and well-armed vessels ideal for fleet escorts."
 NEW_destroyer_4:0 "Battle Class"
 NEW_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Battle class destroyers built upon the evolution of British destroyers used throughout the war The ships were ordered as part of the 1942 and 1943 Naval Programs. They were well-armed in terms of both their guns and their torpedoes. Their AA armament ASW capabilities, speed, and range made them versatile vessels. Their late introduction to the war led to a minimal contribution."
 NEW_light_cruiser_1:0 "C Class"
 NEW_light_cruiser_1_desc:1 "C-class light cruisers were a group of light cruisers built before and during the First World War for the rough conditions of the North Sea. They proved to be rugged and capable vessels despite being somewhat small and cramped. Their armament was more than satisfactory, as they carried enough 6 in. guns to fight enemy surface targets and a heavy torpedo load to finish off enemy vessels and convoys. They saw extensive use during WWI and participated in many surface actions."
 NEW_light_cruiser_2:0 "Southampton Class"
 NEW_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Southampton-class light cruisers were a subclass of the Town-class cruisers and were designed to counter the Japanese Mogami-class cruisers. These vessels were well-armored, had good speed and range, and carried a formidable armament of twelve 6 in. guns in four triple turrets. They were the basis for many of the subsequent RN wartime light cruiser designs."
 NEW_light_cruiser_3:0 "Crown Colony Class"
 NEW_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Crown Colony-class light cruisers were improved versions of the earlier Town class but with a simplified design to speed up construction and reduce costs. The ships carried the same guns as their predecessors, four triple turrets housing 6 in. guns. They were similarly armored but because of their smaller engines, their range is somewhat reduced. The type included two subclasses: Fiji and Ceylon."
 NEW_light_cruiser_4:0 "Minotaur Class"
 NEW_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "Also known as the Swiftsure class, these cruisers were designed as a modified version of the Crown Colony class, incorporating war modifications that were authorized in 1941. They had a longer operational range and more numerous AA weaponry than the Crown Colony class, while the main armament was reduced to three triple turrets. Built too late to affect the outcome of the war, most of the ordered vessels were cancelled afterwards. "
 NEW_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Hawkins Class"
 NEW_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Hawkins-class cruisers were the first heavy cruisers in the world. They were based on the earlier Town-class light cruisers, particularly the Birmingham subclass, but equipped with 7.5 in. guns and a thicker armor belt. They were designed to fight the large convoy raiders of Germany. They were well-armed, had reasonable speed and range, and good protection. Altogether, five ships were commissioned but only four were active at the start of WWII."
 NEW_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Surrey Class"
 NEW_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Surrey-class heavy cruisers were proposed under the 1928 Naval Program. They were improved versions of the earlier York-class heavy cruisers. Had they been completed, they had been equipped with four twin 8 in. gun turrets, heavier armor, and more powerful engines. Two ships were ordered but none were laid down."
 NEW_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Admiral Class"
 NEW_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Admiral-class heavy cruisers (not to be confused with the Admiral-class battlecruisers) were the Royal Navy's last attempt to design and build cruisers armed with 8 in. guns. Design studies started in 1938 and ended in 1941, resulting in various proposals. The final proposals featured new 8 in. guns in triple turrets, a heavy AA armament, thick armor, and good speed. A lack of enemy cruisers and the cost efficiency of these vessels resulted in a focus on building more light cruisers instead."
 NEW_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Churchill Design"
 NEW_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "These ships were proposed by Sir Winston Churchill, Lord of the Admirality, in the early stages of WWII to counter the German Deutschland class big gun cruisers. These vessels had 9.2 in. cannons, heavy AA, and strong armor. They were designed to effectively battle the enemy capital ships. The ships were eventually cancelled because of high costs and a lack of demand for a new heavy cruiser. "
 NEW_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Renown Class"
 NEW_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Renown-class battlecruisers were originally laid down as improved versions of the Revenge-class battleships. Their construction was suspended at the outbreak of WWI. Admiral Lord Fisher managed to restart their construction as battlecruisers. These ships were the quintessential battlecruiser. They were well-armed, fast, and maneuverable, but had thinner armor and a shorter operational range. Only two of the original three ships, Repulse and Renown, were completed."
 NEW_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Princess Royal Class"
 NEW_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Princess Royal is a class of hypothetical battlecruisers that were a faster and cheaper version of the King George V-class battleships. These vessels carried a similar but reduced armament for both surface and anti-air combat: two triple 14 in. cannons and six twin 5.25 in. AA guns. Their fast speed and long range would provide the Royal Navy quick strike capabilities and convoy protection, but their limited armor would prove problematic if they had to fight modern battleships."
 NEW_battleship_1:0 "Queen Elizabeth Class"
 NEW_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Queen Elizabeth-class battleships were ordered under the 1912 Naval Program. These ships were the first to be equipped with 15 in. guns, and were considered the first fast battleships. They carried heavy armament for both primary and secondary roles and their thick armor made these vessels excellent warships, ideal for protecting the vast British Empire. Six ships were ordered but only five were commissioned and later modernized prior to WWII."
 NEW_battleship_2:0 "King George V Class"
 NEW_battleship_2_desc:0 "The King George V-class battleships were the result of the 1922 Washington and 1930 First London Naval Treaties which limited the maximum displacement and gunnery of capital ships. As such, these ships were equipped with smaller-caliber cannons than earlier and even contemporary battleships. Despite the smaller caliber, the ships were adequately armed, carried strong AA weaponry, and had adequate protection. Five ships were ordered and laid down as replacement for the old Queen Elizabeth Class battleships."
 NEW_battleship_3:0 "Lion Class"
 NEW_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Lion-class battleships were the follow-up class to King George V battleships, incorporating many of their features. Six ships were ordered in the 1938 Naval Program to replace the aging Revenge-class battleships but none were finished due to the erupting hostilities. The vessels would have been general similar to the King George-class, but the main armament would be heavier, introducing a new 16 in. cannon. They would also have had thicker armor and more powerful engines."
 NEW_battleship_4:0 "Vanguard Class"
 NEW_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Vanguard-class battleship was the last battleship to be built for the Royal Navy. A single ship was ordered but four more were considered for the Pacific theater. Ordered under the 1940 Emergency War Program, construction did not gain a high priority and was finished after the war. The class had a sleek hull, giving excellent stability and seaworthiness. The armament is the same as the Queen Elizabeth and Revenge class battleships, providing considerable firepower. Strong engines and good armor made the vessel fast and well protected."
 NEW_SH_battleship_1:0 "Centurion Class"
 NEW_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Centurion is a class of hypothetical heavy battleships of the Royal Navy built to counter the large vessels of the German and Japanese navies. Large 18 in. guns and thick armor provide the ship with the necessary firepower and protection to battle these vessels. Strong AA armament, long range, and good speed were a necessity to cover the vast seas of the British Empire."
 NEW_SH_battleship_2:0 "Lion II Class"
 NEW_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Lion II class battleships were designed in 1944 as an improved version of the earlier Lion-class battleship. Incorporating wartime lessons, this design was larger and heavier, and if completed, would carry either three or four triple 16 in. guns of the latest type. Thick armor plates protected the ship from any surface or aerial foe. The cost to build these ships, the defeat of enemy navies, and the need for aircraft carriers resulted in the abandonment of the project."
 NEW_carrier_1:0 "Courageous Class"
 NEW_carrier_1_desc:0 "These three aircraft carriers were converted battlecruisers and were the first fleet carriers of the Royal Navy. Their conversion was the result of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 and the work was finished in 1925. They were moderately-armored but well-armed vessels, with long range and good speed, but due to the nature of the conversion their aircraft complement is limited. Nonetheless, they gave the Royal Navy important experience in aircraft carrier construction and fleet air projection."
 NEW_carrier_2:0 "Ark Royal Class"
 NEW_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Ark Royal aircraft carrier was the first such vessel to be built to fit the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty. She is the first ship on which the hangars and flight deck were an integral part of the hull. Designed in 1934, the vessel is well-armored and armed. It carried a large complement of aircraft and had adequate operational range and speed to keep up with the major forces of the Royal Navy."
 NEW_carrier_3:0 "Illustrious Class"
 NEW_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Illustrious class was designed within the restrictions of the Second London Naval Treaty of 1936, which limited carrier size to an upper limit of 23,000 tons. She was the first British carrier to have an armored flight deck, which reduced its air group size. Heavy armor and AA weaponry provided a strong defense for the ships, while powerful engines and a large fuel store gave the ships long operational range."
 NEW_carrier_4:0 "Implacable Class"
 NEW_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Implacable-class aircraft carriers were ordered under the 1938 Naval Program and were essentially improved versions of the earlier Illustrious class. The war and the shift of priority to smaller vessels for convoy protection duties in the early and middle stages of the war slowed the constriction of these vessels. They were larger vessels able to carry more planes while maintaining thick armor on both the hull and flight deck. More powerful engines gave it greater speed and operational range compared to the Illustrious class."
