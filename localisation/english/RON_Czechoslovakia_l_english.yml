czech.042.a:0 "Tear up the pact."
czech.042.b:0 "War is not the answer."
czech.043.t:0 "Non-aggression compromised"
czech.043.d:0 "Our conflict against Czechoslovakia has triggered a strong response from Moscow. Our carefully crafted non-aggression pact has been torn up on the basis of our aggression against their ally.\n\nWhile the Soviet Union is not obligated to defend Czechoslovakia without France's involvement, they are still in a military alliance together.\n\nThey are outraged at our actions.\n\nThis could prove dangerous."

czech.044.t:0 "Rising Tensions in Poland"
czech.044.d:0 "The Soviet Union has declared it's non-aggression pact with Poland null and void following it's conflict with Soviet ally Czechoslovakia.\n\nPolish officials took a hard line, one of justified conflict and of creating a more secure southern border, and returning Slovakia to historical ownership.\n\nPoland's historical stance of balance has been severely upset, and the Soviet Union has cancelled all leave and is massing troops in Ukraine."

czech.052.d:0 "Czechoslovakia was once just the northern provinces of the Austro-Hungarian empire.

czech.076.t:0 "Peace in Europe"
czech.076.d:0 "The goal of appeasement was to prevent war in Europe.

czech.505.a:0 "It is only escalating."
czech.506.t:0 "Terrorism in Czechoslovakia"
czech.506.d:0 "By order of Hitler himself the Sudetendeutsches Freikorps has been set up as a direct response to Czechoslovakian attempts to enforce order.\n\nAn attack was staged on Police personnel, a sad reality of the local tension, however this time a SdP deputy was struck by an officer. \n\nThe SdP cut off all communication with the incumbent government and planned terrorist strikes across Czechoslovakia. \n\nLord Runciman and his delegation return to the UK a failure. His mission to Czechoslovakia only served as a insight into the apparent local politics."
czech.506.a:0 "It is all for nought."

czech.600.t:0 "Political Fallout"
czech.600.d:0 "Diplomacy has failed, millions of people are no longer part of our country, important resources and industry severed and any fortifications are isolated. \n\nOur government is left in shambles, the ruling party has resigned, the public blaming them for the events that have unfolded.\n\nJan Syrový has set up an interim government however Germany only views Edvard Beneš as an antagonizer. They have forced his resignation and now the future is uncertain."
czech.600.a:0 "Schedule elections."
czech.601.t:0 "Strategy and Circumstances"
czech.601.d:0 "The loss of the Sudetenland has led to a massive revisal of our defensive strategy.\n\nOur country has shrunk by 3.5 million and our attempts to build a wall akin to those in the West have failed, the land they stood on becoming our opponents.\n\nWith the mass armament programs of the German Reich, we have little chance to defend ourselves in a direct confrontation."
czech.601.a:0 "Disaster"
czech.602.t:0 "Decentralisation in Czechoslovakia"
czech.602.d:0 "Upon a background of increasing tension, of divides by ethnicity and unrest in the population, Czechoslovakia and it's centralized government, with it's Czech dominated political elite, is struggling to prevent nationalism and discontent.\n\nIt has long been the dreams of Slovak politicians to dream of a Slovakia within Czechoslovakia where they are self-governing. Josef Tizo has ruthlessly exploited the German plans to win concessions from Prague, and Prague has accepted his proposals.\n\nMilan Hodža took the first steps earlier this year, however the fruits of those labours are now becoming a reality as increased autonomy is granted."
czech.602.a:0 "Whatever it takes."
czech.603.t:0 "Foreign support for Slovakia"
czech.603.d:0 "Slovakia was once just a dream for many, of being free from the Austrian empire, to become part of Czechoslovakia with the Czechs. \n\nHowever the political ideals have changed, nurtured by German declarations and growing support in the heartland of the Slovakian people.\n\nA new dream of an independent Slovakia apart from the Czechs has been pushed to the national focus."
czech.603.a:0 "Concerning."
czech.604.t:0 "Refugees"
czech.604.d:0 "Many of our Czech countrymen and a small proportion of the sympathetic German population have fled across the border from the Sudetenland, fleeing the fascist state they were forced into. \n\nThey seek refuge within our borders and new opportunities. However winter is coming."
czech.604.a:0 "We must find them shelter"
czech.606.t:0 "Presidential Elections"
czech.606.d:0 "Edvard Beneš has been at the forefront of politics since the independence of our country, however he has now gone into exile in Putney, London.\n\nEmil Hácha is the chosen successor, as an individual outside the establishment he is palatable to all involved. His values are non-controversial and his career as a lawyer respected. "
czech.606.a:0 "Replace him."
czech.606.b:0 "Reject his resignation"
czech.607.t:0 "Slovakian Elections"
czech.607.d:0 "We promised increase autonomy to Slovakia, we have delivered. \n\nHowever the Slovaks have chosen to frame their elections not as a vote for self-governing, but as a referendum for indepence, to leave our union."
czech.607.a:0 "Very Well."
czech.607.b:0 "Intervene."


czech.700.t:0 "Slovakia declares independence!"
czech.700.d:0 "While we deal with our confrontation with Germany, our union has been toppled. Josef Tiso was appointed the Slovak president, however his deliberate destruction and prohibition of alternate political parties, and his indepence talks with Germany forced us to remove him by military force on the 9th March.\n\nSo he travelled westwards, to seek a solution\n\nJosef Tiso returned from Berlin with the support of Hitler. With the looming threat of invasion in the case of non-compliance, the Slovak Parliament met and unanimously declared independence."
czech.700.a:0 "We have been outmanuevered."
czech.701.t:0 "Carpathian Ruthenia declares independence"
czech.701.d:0 "Inspired by Slovakia's declaration, and loss of a geographical connection between Carpathian Ruthenia, they too have taken the step of seceding from our country. \n\nUnfortunately for them there was no foreign support for them, and they were invaded and annexed within 24 hours, becoming part of Hungary. \n\nMarking a very short period as an independent nation, one which failed to be recognized."
czech.701.a:0 "We have been completely divided"

czech.750.t:0 "Slovakia"
czech.750.d:0 "Our intervention has paid off, we have destroyed Czechoslovakia, broken it into down into it's individual pieces, hopefully to never return. However in our time of victory, we must remember what we have promised. An independent Slovakia."
czech.750.a:0 "With a sympathetic Government of course."

czech.800.t:0 "Betrayal!"
czech.800.d:0 "The alliance guaranteeing our indepedence has in a single motion made the greatest threat to our independence of any nations in our history.\n\nThe Soviet offer of aid hinges directly upon the support of the French, without them we are completely alone.\n\nEven if the USSR came to our aid, Romania and Poland would never agree to their troops within their soil."
czech.800.a:0 "Disaster"
czech.801.t:0 "Alliance remade"
czech.801.d:0 "The allies have seen the error of their ways and have in a single motion seen fit to prevent the greatest calamity of the time."
czech.801.a:0 "Excellent"
czech.804.t:0 "Territorial Dispute"
czech.804.d:0 "How can we survive as an alliance if we fight over our own border disputes while ignoring the dangers of the Great Powers which dominate the region."
czech.804.a:0 "Return their territory"
czech.805.t:0 "Territory returned"
czech.805.d:0 "We are fortunate. Our alliance not only provides us with security but has led to the return of our lost territories."

czech.807.a:0 "Huzzah"
czech.808.t:0 "Revisionism fails"
czech.808.d:0 "With the war raging between Germany and Czechoslovakia, our ability to leverage the threat of Germany against the Czechs has been lost.\n\nIn their increasingly desperate position. It is almost impossible to negotiate a settlement so sensitive as this.\n\nThe Fuhrer warned us that we would need to be a cook in his kitchen if we wanted a slice of the pie."
czech.808.a:0 "Very Well"

He was a weak leader, taking up the mantle in his waning years.\n\nHe was forced to make imposible decisions and was intimidated by Hitler. Allied leaders doing little to support his country in his crisis.\n\nWith the office of President and it's powers eroded by Germany, Emil Hácha became little more than a puppet."
