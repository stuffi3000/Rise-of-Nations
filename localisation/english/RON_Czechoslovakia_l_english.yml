He has long campaigned for the secession of the Sudetenland as an independent state.\n\nThe Pro-German portion of the party has swiftly reacted to strengthen their position.\n\nResponding to internal pressure from within his party, Heinlein has become a staunch follower of Adolf Hitler. He has adopted the slogan Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein Führer! (One People, One Country, One Leader!)"
czech.310.a:0 "A disappointing turn of events."


czech.321.t:0 "Border Friction"
czech.321.d:0 "Polish-Czechoslovak relations have been sourced since 1920. Zaolzie's ownership was arbitrated by the allies after the Great War, with both Poland and Czechoslovakia making claims to it and it's rich coal and transport links.\n\nBeneš has convinced the Polish to sign an agreement to abide by Allied judgement, while having already secured Allied favour himself. Warsaw felt betrayed and the relationship was soured.\n\nThe dream of European integration was raised by Milan Hodža, but disagreements such as this must be settled."
czech.321.a:0 "Return Zaolzie."
czech.321.b:0 "It is ours."
czech.322.t:0 "Diplomactic overtures to Hungary"
czech.322.d:0 "In an attempt to relieve tension in the region, and to secure Czechoslovakia's southern border, the Czech government reached out to Hungary.\n\nOffering to relax the regional attitude to Hungarian rearmament in exchange for a non-aggression pact.\n\nHowever at this point it was an open secret that Hungary was rearming. The Little Entente had failed to challenge their rearmament, too caught up in their own individual threats.\n\nMiklós Horthy recognized that the Czechs were offering very little that they were not already taking for themselves."
czech.322.a:0 "A missed opportunity."


czech.400.t:0 "Hitler addresses the Reichstag"
czech.400.d:0 "Hitler launched a grand speech to the German government, the Reichstag. \n\nHe spoke of History, the Economy, about creating work and the recession. \n\nConcerningly however he talks of 10 million German men and women in bordering countries. Countries he claims oppress them, and deprive them of their rights, their rights of self-determination as determined by the armistice. Countries he claims are increasingly embracing Bolshevism. It is obvious which nation he is refering to."
czech.400.a:0 "Concerning."
czech.401.t:0 "Secret SdP meeting with the Fuhrer"
czech.401.d:0 "The pro-Nazi Sudeten German Party leader, Konrad Henlein traveled secretly to Germany to meet with the Adolf Hitler. \n\nWhat they have discussed is a mystery still but it can only be concerning the fate of the Sudetenland and the peoples within it."
czech.401.a:0 "A sign of things to come."
czech.402.t:0 "Sudetenland Demands"
czech.402.d:0 "Today the Sudeten German Party demanded a series of reforms, chiefly among them was a demand for the autonomy of German minorities. \n\nKnown as the Carlsbad Program, it was a comprehensive list of demands upon the Czechoslovak government.\n\nThe demands involved a significant devolution of powers to the individual regions."
czech.402.a:0 "Autonomy is too much."
czech.403.t:0 "Ethnic-German rhetoric"
czech.403.d:0 "Hitler spoke to a large audience in Berlin today, talking about progress in Europe, about the peace the German people have found in Europe and their role. About reuniting the German people, and freeing them from the oppression of Beneš. His speech continues to demand that the right of self-determination of the 3,500,000 million Germans in the Sudetenland be enforced. \n\nThe large German-speaking minorities in our borders and the advance of Fascism has taken a hold of a significant part of our political scene. The party now has over 1.3 million members. \n\nTheir single party dominates nearly the entire ethnic-German vote in our country."
czech.403.a:0 "A sign of things to come."
czech.404.t:0 "Border Threats"
czech.404.d:0 "We have been informed of a build up of German forces, we fear a surprise attack is imminent, but the reports are unsubstantiated. Movements of Wehrmacht divisions out of their border garrisons gives an indication of potential military action. \n\nHitlers rhetoric about enforcing the rights of the ethnic Germans only confirms this. \n\nOur diplomat in Moscow, Zdeněk Fierlinger, informs us that the Red Army has taken measures to come to our aid in the case of conflict."
czech.404.a:0 "Take precautions."
czech.404.b:0 "We must be careful."
czech.405.t:0 "Increased Tension"
czech.405.d:0 "There is absolutely no evidence of any aggression at our border. We have been made a fool on the grand stage.\n\nEither the Germans made no movements, or they cleaned up the situation beyond any doubt. \n\nThis leaves us exposed, poltically."
czech.405.a:0 "Blame the Germans"
czech.405.b:0 "The Soviets misled us"
czech.405.c:0 "The British are abandoning us"
czech.405.e:0 "War is inevitable. Make it happen."
czech.406.t:0 "War with Germany"
czech.406.d:0 "War is inevitable.\n\nIf not today, then soon.\n\nOur only recourse is to force this war before more damage can be done peacefully. They have caused separatism between our minorities. They have divided our alliance, and those who might be our friends have distracted themselves with petty squabbles."
czech.406.a:0 "It is necessary"
czech.407.t:0 "War declared in Europe"
czech.407.d:0 "Czechoslovakia has declared war upon Nazi Germany, citing self-defense and German aggession, both domestic and militarily.\n\nThis is a dark day for Europe. It is unknown what lies in store, however the other powers have not reacted to the development favourably. While England and France both are obligated to defend Czechoslovakia, they do not believe that Germany are the aggressors."
czech.407.a:0 "Very well"
czech.408.t:0 "34th International Eucharistic Congress"
czech.408.d:0 "Josef Tiso, a leading politician of the Slovak People's Party was also a Roman Catholic priest, he attended the annual Eucharistic congress in Budapest, where he was sought out by Hungarian Foreign Minister Kálmán Kánya.\n\nThe Hungarians sought to mimic the success of the SdP and further break apart Czechoslovakia. The Hungarians held the view that Slovakia was a historical claim of their nation, but were willing to offer the Slovakians far greater autonomy than that they enjoyed under Czechoslovakia.\n\nTiso was unimpressed. His ambition was greater than that. Slovakia's economy was weak without the Czechs, and he believed he could achieve more in the union, for now."
czech.408.a:0 "Very well"

czech.420.t:0 "Second capital in Czechoslovakia"
czech.420.d:0 "Our efforts to create a more secure wartime capital are somewhat flawed, Prague is surrounded by strong defensive mountains, but it has lengthy borders with Germany.\n\nA second capital in Slovakia may be prudent, politically it would raise Slovakian spirits in our Czech-dominated politics, but would prove more defensible against Germany and further from the Luftwaffe.\n\nBratislava, the capital of Slovakia is just 60km from the border, and rapidly would be on the front line.\n\nOf our neighbours, our Hungary border is probably the most stable, and Košice has many palaces that can be repurposed."
czech.420.a:0 "Košice it is"
czech.421.t:0 "Easterly Migration"
czech.421.d:0 "The Civil service and many of our banks are now creating new offices in our new second city.\n\nNon-essential resources are already making their moves and banks are building new vaults capable of holding their material wealth.\n\nMany Czechs relocate with these institutions and they bring additional wealth to the region."
czech.421.a:0 "Very well"
czech.422.t:0 "Slovakian influence grows"
czech.422.d:0 "Between the movement of resources, of institutions and massive investment undertaken in Slovakia, the depression is lifting.\n\nMany Slovakians viewed Czech-dominated politics as advancing the Czech agenda at the expense of their own. So much has changed since then.\n\nA new age of prosperity has come to Slovakia. Many still believe war is not inevitable and have not come to realise what the future holds."
czech.422.a:0 "Unity grows"
czech.423.t:0 "Government moved to Košice"
czech.423.d:0 "Was has been declared. Germany has opted to take the Sudetenland by force, and possibly will not stop there.\n\nOur planning prepared Košice as a second location, and we have moved many of our more important organisations east.\n\nWhile Prague may fall, we must hold Slovakia, and content ourselves with retaking our Czech lands later.\n\nWhat is important now is holding our nation together."
czech.423.a:0 "Very well"

czech.500.t:0 "Anti-semitism peaks in Germany"
czech.500.d:0 "Jews in Germany are receiving increasing punitive measures.\n\nIncreasingly the Jewish population is being excluded from public services and private businesses.\n\nThe German government has mandated that the population be registered and issued with ID cards."
czech.500.a:0 "Something is brewing"
czech.501.t:0 "Lord Runciman arrives in Prague"
czech.501.d:0 "On the 4th of August, the British government in an attempt to end the dispute between Czechoslovakia and Germany concerning the Sudetenland, have sent Lord Runciman and a delegation. To allievate tensions in the region, to mediate between the two parties, and to judge the situation. \n\nHowever while Edvard Beneš meets with him, he has so far failed to meet the SdP leadership, instead spending his time among the local SdP-sympathetic aristocracy."
czech.501.a:0 "Very well."
czech.502.t:0 "The Bled Agreement"
czech.502.d:0 "The Treaty of Trianon imposed numerous restrictions on the state of Hungary, one of many treaties designed to prevent a future war by removing the opposition's ability to fight one. \n\nThe agreement was simple, remove the restrictions on Hungary and create a formal non-aggression pact. The issue of minorities would be dealt with separately between individual countries. Hungary made greater demands of Czechoslovakia than the other countries and they did not not come to a conclusion before the Munich Diktat and subsequent Vienna Award.\n\nThe Fuhrer is furious."
czech.502.a:0 "Sensible."
czech.503.t:0 "Negotiation stalled"
czech.503.d:0 "On the 24th of August, the Lord Runciman presented a proposal, one which compromised President Beneš original position but one which potentially offered peace. \n\nHowever any progress was halted by a string of killings of police and customs officials on the border staged by the SdP. \n\nThe perpetrators fleeing across the border to Germany, away from justice."
czech.503.a:0 "Of course they will not accept it."
czech.504.t:0 "President Beneš capitulates"
czech.504.d:0 "On the 9th of September, SdP negotiators returned to Prague castle today, to find a President without his usual pleasantries or energy. \n\nHe produced a piece of paper and invited them to write down their demands. When they failed to, he offered to write them for them. The SdP negotiators had never planned for this eventuality. They dictated their demands. Beneš accepted them all. He signed the list and bid his guest goodbye. He had given them everything. \n\nThey did not accept."
czech.504.a:0 "There was never hope for negotiating."
czech.505.t:0 "Mass Government resignations"
czech.505.d:0 "The incumbent Government led by Milan Hodža has broken down\n\nIn Germany, Hitler rallies his people at the annual Nuremberg rally\n\nMeanwhile Neville Chamberlain flew to Cologne to obtain a new peace. He offered Hitler the entirety of the Sudetenland. Hitler responded that the only solution was the dissolution of Czechoslovakia. That evening they agreed immediate annexation but to honour the new borders.\n\nIn Czechoslovakia, Edvard Beneš appointed Jan Syrový the new prime minister. Ordering him to take up the mantle. His first action was to order the full mobilization of the army."
czech.505.a:0 "It is only escalating."
czech.506.t:0 "Terrorism in Czechoslovakia"
czech.506.d:0 "By order of Hitler himself the Sudetendeutsches Freikorps has been set up as a direct response to Czechoslovakian attempts to enforce order.\n\nAn attack was staged on Police personnel, a sad reality of the local tension, however this time a SdP deputy was struck by an officer. \n\nThe SdP cut off all communication with the incumbent government and planned terrorist strikes across Czechoslovakia. \n\nLord Runciman and his delegation return to the UK a failure. His mission to Czechoslovakia only served as a insight into the apparent local politics."
czech.506.a:0 "It is all for nought."

czech.600.t:0 "Political Fallout"
czech.600.d:0 "Diplomacy has failed, millions of people are no longer part of our country, important resources and industry severed and any fortifications are isolated. \n\nOur government is left in shambles, the ruling party has resigned, the public blaming them for the events that have unfolded.\n\nJan Syrový has set up an interim government however Germany only views Edvard Beneš as an antagonizer. They have forced his resignation and now the future is uncertain."
czech.600.a:0 "Schedule elections."
czech.601.t:0 "Strategy and Circumstances"
czech.601.d:0 "The loss of the Sudetenland has led to a massive revisal of our defensive strategy.\n\nOur country has shrunk by 3.5 million and our attempts to build a wall akin to those in the West have failed, the land they stood on becoming our opponents.\n\nWith the mass armament programs of the German Reich, we have little chance to defend ourselves in a direct confrontation."
czech.601.a:0 "Disaster"
czech.602.t:0 "Decentralisation in Czechoslovakia"
czech.602.d:0 "Upon a background of increasing tension, of divides by ethnicity and unrest in the population, Czechoslovakia and it's centralized government, with it's Czech dominated political elite, is struggling to prevent nationalism and discontent.\n\nIt has long been the dreams of Slovak politicians to dream of a Slovakia within Czechoslovakia where they are self-governing. Josef Tizo has ruthlessly exploited the German plans to win concessions from Prague, and Prague has accepted his proposals.\n\nMilan Hodža took the first steps earlier this year, however the fruits of those labours are now becoming a reality as increased autonomy is granted."
czech.602.a:0 "Whatever it takes."
czech.603.t:0 "Foreign support for Slovakia"
czech.603.d:0 "Slovakia was once just a dream for many, of being free from the Austrian empire, to become part of Czechoslovakia with the Czechs. \n\nHowever the political ideals have changed, nurtured by German declarations and growing support in the heartland of the Slovakian people.\n\nA new dream of an independent Slovakia apart from the Czechs has been pushed to the national focus."
czech.603.a:0 "Concerning."
czech.604.t:0 "Refugees"
czech.604.d:0 "Many of our Czech countrymen and a small proportion of the sympathetic German population have fled across the border from the Sudetenland, fleeing the fascist state they were forced into. \n\nThey seek refuge within our borders and new opportunities. However winter is coming."
czech.604.a:0 "We must find them shelter"
czech.606.t:0 "Presidential Elections"
czech.606.d:0 "Edvard Beneš has been at the forefront of politics since the independence of our country, however he has now gone into exile in Putney, London.\n\nEmil Hácha is the chosen successor, as an individual outside the establishment he is palatable to all involved. His values are non-controversial and his career as a lawyer respected. "
czech.606.a:0 "Replace him."
czech.606.b:0 "Reject his resignation"
czech.607.t:0 "Slovakian Elections"
czech.607.d:0 "We promised increase autonomy to Slovakia, we have delivered. \n\nHowever the Slovaks have chosen to frame their elections not as a vote for self-governing, but as a referendum for indepence, to leave our union."
czech.607.a:0 "Very Well."
czech.607.b:0 "Intervene."


czech.700.t:0 "Slovakia declares independence!"
czech.700.d:0 "While we deal with our confrontation with Germany, our union has been toppled. Josef Tiso was appointed the Slovak president, however his deliberate destruction and prohibition of alternate political parties, and his indepence talks with Germany forced us to remove him by military force on the 9th March.\n\nSo he travelled westwards, to seek a solution\n\nJosef Tiso returned from Berlin with the support of Hitler. With the looming threat of invasion in the case of non-compliance, the Slovak Parliament met and unanimously declared independence."
czech.700.a:0 "We have been outmanuevered."
czech.701.t:0 "Carpathian Ruthenia declares independence"
czech.701.d:0 "Inspired by Slovakia's declaration, and loss of a geographical connection between Carpathian Ruthenia, they too have taken the step of seceding from our country. \n\nUnfortunately for them there was no foreign support for them, and they were invaded and annexed within 24 hours, becoming part of Hungary. \n\nMarking a very short period as an independent nation, one which failed to be recognized."
czech.701.a:0 "We have been completely divided"

czech.750.t:0 "Slovakia"
czech.750.d:0 "Our intervention has paid off, we have destroyed Czechoslovakia, broken it into down into it's individual pieces, hopefully to never return. However in our time of victory, we must remember what we have promised. An independent Slovakia."
czech.750.a:0 "With a sympathetic Government of course."

czech.800.t:0 "Betrayal!"
czech.800.d:0 "The alliance guaranteeing our indepedence has in a single motion made the greatest threat to our independence of any nations in our history.\n\nThe Soviet offer of aid hinges directly upon the support of the French, without them we are completely alone.\n\nEven if the USSR came to our aid, Romania and Poland would never agree to their troops within their soil."
czech.800.a:0 "Disaster"
czech.801.t:0 "Alliance remade"
czech.801.d:0 "The allies have seen the error of their ways and have in a single motion seen fit to prevent the greatest calamity of the time."

czech.808.d:0 "With the war raging between Germany and Czechoslovakia, our ability to leverage the threat of Germany against the Czechs has been lost.\n\nIn their increasingly desperate position.
