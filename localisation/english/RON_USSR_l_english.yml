Stalin was then executed by firing squad on live radio."

 soviet.70.t:0"The Soviet Union Demands that we Return Land to China"
 soviet.70.d:0"The Soviets have demanded that we cede Mengkukuo, Manchukuo, and occupied Hebei to the People's Republic of China, else they will declare war on us. In return, they claim that they will give us North Sakhalin. This is a very poor trade, but we can ill-afford a war with the Soviets. What shall we do?" 
 soviet.70.a:0"We will comply with their unreasonable demands."

 soviet.71.t:0"Japanese Immediately cede Chinese lands"
 soviet.71.d:0"The Japanese have chosen to comply with our demands. Troops from the People's Republic of China have already established control over Manchuria and Beijing. It is now up to us to deliver on our part of the deal." 
 soviet.71.a:0"Very well."
 
 soviet.72.t:0"The Japanese Refuse Us"
 soviet.72.d:0"The Japanese have rejected our proposal and expelled our diplomats. That they would dare to do such a thing is inconcievable. Trotsky must declare war on them as he promised, else lose all credibility. Luckily for us, our diligent general staff already has an operation in progress to punish the Japanese for their insolence." 
 soviet.72.a:0"We have prepared for this."
 
 soviet.73.t:0"Soviet Troops Seize Hokkaido"
 soviet.73.d:0"The Japanese high command was shocked today to hear that Soviet Paratroopers are landing in the region of Hokkaido, eliminating our garrisons there and securing the entire region for the Soviet Union.

 soviet.74.t:0"Japan Wishes to Barter"
 soviet.74.d:0"The Japanese have informed us that they are open to ceding land back to the Chinese people, but that we must offer them something better. That we must barter with the Japanese like meiserly capitalist pigs is extremely insulting. How shall we react?"

 soviet.75.a:0"Hostilities commense."
 
 soviet.76.t:0"The Soviets Offer us Dockyards"
 soviet.76.d:0"In response to our request, the Soviet Union has proposed to send us dockyard equipment so that we can construct new drydocks, disassembling their own drydock machinery in the process. It seems that they want to give us industry that we cannot use to make weapons against them. Is this deal satisfactory to us?" 
 soviet.76.a:0"It is satisfactory."
 soviet.76.b:0"Ask for industrial goods instead."
 
 soviet.77.t:0"Japan Accepts Dockyards"
 soviet.77.d:0"The Japanese have accepted our proposal to disassemble our dockyard machinery to ship to Japan in exchange for Chinese land. While this is more than we had originally intended to give up, we have completed our objective and this must be counted as a win for Trotsky and the Soviet people as a whole." 
 soviet.77.a:0"A Fair Deal."
 
 soviet.78.t:0"The Japanese Request Industrial Goods"
 soviet.78.d:0"The Japanese have rejected our offer of naval dockyards and have instead proposed that we give them industrial goods instead. The Japanese claim that they understand our reluctance to provide anything that can be used against us in the future, but that these industrial goods will be used for civilian consumption." 
 soviet.78.a:0"Very well, we accept the deal."
 soviet.78.b:0"We think not, the Japanese are lying."
 
 soviet.79.t:0"The Soviets Accept our Proposal"
 soviet.79.d:0"The Soviets have agreed to give us civilian industry, at economic cost to themselves. It wasn't too bad of a deal in the end, we should be able to use this newly acquired industry to reinvigorate our own domestic arms industry." 
 soviet.79.a:0"The best possible outcome."
 
 soviet.80.t:0"Talks Break Down"
 soviet.80.d:0"Not only have the Soviets rejected our proposal, but they seem to have lost interest in the affair altogether. We have just learned that the Soviet delegation has departed and our foreign ministry doubts that we will hear from them anytime soon." 
 soviet.80.a:0"What a relief."
 
 soviet.81.t:0"Beginning of the Lend-Lease Programme"
 soviet.81.d:0"American aid will be invaluable to us. They will help specialize and supplement our production, and where our production is lacking. Unfortunately it will be some months before the first major shipment gets here." 
 soviet.81.a:0"We will have to wait."
 
 soviet.82.t:0"First Delivery"
 soviet.82.d:0"The first allied lend-lease shipment has arrived. The sheer number of vehicles, jeeps, and various equipment is staggering. The British, surprisingly, have sent us a significant amount of aid also. The trucks we have received are doubly useful for moving supplies, but also towing our old artillery which have been sitting in our reserves." 
 soviet.82.a:0"About time."
 
 soviet.83.t:0"Second Delivery"
 soviet.83.d:0"This second allied shipment has managed to surpass the last one in terms of equipment sent. The American trucks are very reliable and robust - an excellent platform for our new rocket artillery platforms. We will turn the American Studebakers into Katusha rocket launchers and strike fear very deep into the german lines." 
 soviet.83.a:0"Excellent."
 
 soviet.84.t:0"Third Delivery"
 soviet.84.d:0"We have received a greatly increased amount of tanks and armored vehicles as well as aircraft, in comparison with the last major shipment." 
 soviet.84.a:0"Right on time."
 
 soviet.85.t:0"Fourth Delivery"
 soviet.85.d:0"Our western allies continue to supplement our production. While this arrangement will be coming to an end very soon, it undoubtedly provided significant assistance to us in our fight against fascism." 
 soviet.85.a:0"Keep it up."
 
 soviet.86.t:0"Final Delivery"
 soviet.86.d:0"Today we have received our last major lend-lease shipment from the western democracies. Unfortunately they tell us that they can help us no longer. On the bright side, what most of the equipment we currently have in service will eventually wear down and be scrapped before the end of the war, erasing our debt to the Americans under the terms of lend-lease."
 soviet.86.a:0"Too bad."
 
 soviet.87.t:0"The Fall of Moscow"
 soviet.87.d:0"Unfortunately we have lost Moscow. We have prepared for this eventuality and have moved our capital to Kuybyshev, which will hopefully be out of the range of the current enemy offense." 
 soviet.87.a:0"We must relocate our capital!"
 
 soviet.88.t:0"Moscow Recaptured"

 soviet.88.a:0"We can move our capital back now."
 
 soviet.89.t:0"The Great Patriotic War"
 soviet.89.d:0"German treachery will not go unanswered. The Motherland has assembled fresh manpower reserves to send to the fight. The Nazis cannot win in the face of such overwhelming oppositions. Our men will all fight and die as heroes until the Nazi scum have no more fodder to send to our butchery." 
 soviet.89.a:0"We will fight until the last drop of blood."
 
 soviet.90.t:0"Continuation of the Great Patriotic War"
 soviet.90.d:0"The memory of the German betrayal will stay with us always. We will never forget those who perished because of tolerance for fascism that existed throughout the world at one time."

 soviet.91.t:0"The Soviet Union Tests Detonation of a Plutonium Bomb"

RON_Russian_Alt_History.70.t:0"The Military Government"
RON_Russian_Alt_History.70.d:0"A military dictatorship is a dictatorship in which the military exerts complete or substantial control over political authority, and the dictator is often a high-ranked military officer. A military junta is a government led by a committee of military leaders. The term junta means 'meeting' or 'committee' and originated in the national and local junta organized by the Spanish resistance to Napoleon's invasion of Spain in 1808. The term is now used to refer to an authoritarian form of government characterized by oligarchic military dictatorship, as distinguished from other categories of authoritarian rule, specifically strongman (autocratic military dictatorships); machine (oligarchic party dictatorships); and bossism (autocratic party dictatorships). A junta often comes to power as a result of a coup d'état. The junta may either formally take power as the nation's governing body, with the power to rule by decree, or may wield power by exercising binding (but informal) control over a nominally civilian government. These two forms of junta rule are sometimes called open rule and disguised rule. Disguised rule may take the form of either civilianization or indirect rule. Civilianization occurs when a junta publicly ends its obviously military features, but continues its dominance. For example, the junta may terminate martial law, forgo military uniforms in favor of civilian attire, 'colonize' government with former military officers, and make use of political parties or mass organizations. 'Indirect rule' involves the junta's exertion of concealed, behind-the-scenes control over a civilian puppet. Indirect rule by the military can include either broad control over the government or control over a narrower set of policy areas, such as military or national security matters. Who will lead the Military Government?"

RON_Russian_Alt_History.71.t:0"The Russian Fascist Party"
RON_Russian_Alt_History.71.d:0"The Russian Fascist Party (RFP), sometimes called the All-Russian Fascist Party, was a minor Russian émigré movement that was based in Manchukuo during the 1930s and 1940s. The defeat of the White Armies in the Russian Civil War of 1917-1922, which discredited the older White leaders, together with the rise of the Fascism in Italy caused many younger Russian emigres to look to fascism as an alternative that might best Communism. The fascist movement among the White émigrés existed around the world, but the majority of its supporters lived in Manchuria and in the United States. A number of Russians had settled in Manchuria when the Russian Empire had occupied the region from 1900 to 1905, and numbers increased from an influx fleeing after the Red Army victory in the Russian Civil War. A secret convention of the various groups took place, leading to the foundation of the RFP under the presidency of Major General Vladimir Dmitrievich Kozmin. Konstantin Rodzaevsky became Secretary General of the party's central committee on May 26, 1931, becoming the de facto leader of the party. Adopting the slogan"God, Nation, Labour" and publishing the journal Natsiya ("Nation"), the party called for Italian-style fascism to take advantage of the shaky position of the Bolshevik leaders in the face of both external and internal opposition."

RON_Russian_Alt_History.72.t:0"The All-Russian Fascist Organization"
RON_Russian_Alt_History.72.d:0"The All-Russian Fascist Organization (VFO) was a Russian white émigré group led by Anastasy Vonsyatsky. It was based in Putnam, Connecticut, United States and was founded on May 10, 1933. In 1934, in Yokohama, the Russian Fascist Party (RFP) and VFO attempted to merge into a new entity, the All-Russia Fascist Party. On April 3, 1934, representatives from both organisations signed a protocol number 1, which proclaimed the merger of RFP and VFO and the creation of the All-Russia Fascist Party (VFP). The new organisation was intended to connect the RFP's organizational structure with the financial resources of the VFO. April 26, 1934, in Harbin on 2-m (Unity) Congress of Russian Fascists happened formal association VFO and the RFP and the creation of the All-Russia Fascist Party."

rus.1.d:0 "After the defeat of the perfidious Bolshevik hordes in 1920 it was hoped that the Russian people could finally rest easy. Yet fate had more in store, and history tends towards a twisted sense of humor. The Republican government that followed victory was a rotting house built upon a twisted structure. At its top was Kerensky, an ineffective figurehead who allowed ancestral lands to be sold away in the treaty of Brest Litovsk.Yet despite this state of affairs, all was not lost. Kerensky’s days became numbered following the 1924 Kolchak Putsch and the disastrous loss of Transamaur that followed. In secret, Russia's hero; Lavr Kornilov bided his time. He had defeated the Bolsheviks before, so again would he defeat the ineffectual puppets in the Duma.\n\nIn 1936, the inevitable day arrived. Before Kerensky’s body had even been recovered from the senate steps, swift plans were sprung into motion. In Saratov the Sons of the Motherland mobilised, eager at the chance to finally save the people from themselves. Had they refused to act, there would have been no telling who the democrats and their masonic handlers would have appointed.It was Kornilov who returned glory to the land, Kornilov who defeated the Hun, Kornilov who  united the race, and Kornilov who established the five headed regime. Russia was strong again, proud and free! The people rejoiced and praised the efforts of their Vozhd. Yet With his holy duty finished, the Vohzd traveled skywards, ready to dispense his foes on the astral plane.\n\nnToday a new face rules; Nikolai Skoblin, a man who by all accounts does not fill his predecessors shoes. Ruling with a mix of guile and nostalgia, his faction of Young Kornilovites is dually led by Mikhail Levitov, Skoblin’s deputy and right hand. Together they have sought to fulfill the vision of the great hero who came before, sticking closely, if unimaginatively, to his teachings. Dark forces brew beneath the surface. With each passing day, the “Loyal” minorities grow increasingly discontent and the Eurasianists, Illyinists, and the Black Hundreds plot to reshape the nation in their image. Without the guiding hand of its paternal father disorder has begun to rear its ugly head yet again. Should the National-State fail, the world will be left to the decadent socialists.

After repeated calculations and careful review, there is still no sign of positive change in the output of any of the large estates which the survey deemed as insufficient. And these large estates are heavily dependent on the government's subsidies despite their dismal performance as a whole.\n\nThe report also stated that a majority of the smaller estates and of the lands owned by the rest of the people who were involved in the agriculture and agricultural industry of Russia are performing well but not well enough. Complaints and observations have been noted that these lands and estates were far too small to produce the necessary numbers projected for the future.

He stood up from his desk chair, assumed a confident posture, and retorted.\n\n"Calm yourself Mikhail! I have afforded you many privileges, but insubordination was not one of them! I am your Vohzd!"\n\nLevitov broke into boisterous laughter at the assertion, amused at the palpable irony that pervaded the air. He had just returned from Kiev, where the fruits of Skoblin's labour could be seen in the burning buildings and wounded soldiers. He took a deep breath, and stared at his old friend. Suddenly he realized the futility of this endeavor. In the office of the Vozhd, there could be no room for weakness or petty outburst.

As the old Vohzd's most loyal allies were replaced or exiled, Pyotor Wrangel grew quiet, seemingly tired by such a brazen display of opportunism and youthful folly.Now, he has returned. Around him gathers a party of the alienated; military officers who tire of the spectacle, old guard remnants and prominent whites. In Levitov's quest to depose a "weak" Vohzd, he has exposed his own weakness and  treasonous ambition.\n\nToday, the party marched on Moscow, and with the backing of the military following Levitov's failed stunt, forced Skoblin to resign.

It appears that unlike the Governor-General, they are sensible. Aware that their so-called “secret army” can not hold out against us forever, they have dictated terms. \n\nAmong these terms are the restoration of an independent constitution, parliament, and a domestic leader rather than a Ministry bureaucrat.\n\n General Levitov has strongly opposed concessions of any kind. In his view, such a deal would be “independence in all but name” and would “provide a bolshevik foothold on our border.” He also believes the rebellion to be losing steam. Instead, Levitov has requested a full invasion of Finland by the northwest armed forces.\n\nNaturally, the political consequences of raising several field armies to fight a rebellion that we have repeatedly denied the existence of would be dire.

Kolhack’s Japanese handlers moved too swiftly and Vladivostok was stolen yet again, this time by conniving foreigners. In what would come to be known as the 1946 “Second Amur Incident” Russian troops were stopped before they could cross the border and all loyal formations in the city found themselves arrested in their barracks.\n\nSince then Transamur has remained a black stain on an otherwise spotless reputation. It is the greatest humiliation that the land was not reclaimed when the Vohzd drew breath. Internal turmoil has prevented us from correcting this injustice in the past, yet it shall no longer! The population of the region has been openly hostile to their occupiers since our stirring victory in the Great Patriotic War.

Yet what was once a nuisance has become shockingly disruptive. Perhaps they are simply reacting to the recent wartime triumph of their native land, or perhaps these events are simply inevitable when dealing with such an uncouth people.\n\nRegardless, the Russian government has once before attempted to seize the region from us.The situation must be handled swiftly and harshly, so as not to display weakness.

It involves the deployment of several squads; highly armed and professionally trained TaGOP agents who would assault key points. These squads would work under plausible deniability, allowing the rioters to fully seize the region and providing us with a preRUSt to step in and “Restore Order”.\n\nThe second scenario is certainly bold and fittingly swift, however it may be heavy handed. The army is advocating a mass infiltration operation under the cover of night. Then when the moment is right our soldiers would spring into action. With the Japanese already given a bloody nose by the insurrectionary rioters, surely the overwhelming intervention of our soldiers would force the Japanese into a full withdrawal?\n\nThe window of opportunity grows smaller.

It was by sheer chance that the worn vehicle blew its tire in the marshlands, and even less likely that his child spotted an errant flashlight in the treeline.

They carried professional weaponry, were outfitted in tactical gear and behaved as if they were a cohesive fireteam. Though they had no uniforms and have thus far refused to provide any information regarding their motives it is unquestionable that these were not simply members of the rabble. Considering these factors as well as their location close to the border, it seems highly likely that the men are servants of the Russian government.\n\nMilitary reinforcements have been authorised in the northern reaches of Transamur following the incident and existing police patrols have been placed on even higher alert.

It was not till they hit marshland that trouble arose; a family of Japanese colonisers repairing their flat tire.  Agent Amelin switched off his flashlight worriedly, though thankfully none of his comrades were spotted. It was on this leg of the journey that he suppressed the tiniest nugget of rage towards the family he eyed from a safe distance. They were foreign bastards, outright thieving the spiritual territory of his people! He forced the thought to fade, bringing his mind to the mission yet again.\n\nFinally they reached the outskirts of the city and the air sat thick with smoke. A post office served as both a mass changing room and a forward operating base.

Konstantin had actually been excited to do his part in liberating Transamur. The plan was to infiltrate the city and coordinate with the local insurrection.

Instead they found a fortified countryside with heavy machine gun emplacements and cloaked snipers in the trees. They hadn't stood a chance, and were lucky to get out alive.Now they were returning home as fast as they could, fully aware that being so deep in enemy territory made an encirclement likely. The mission had failed, and all that they could do now was scurry with tails between their legs and survive.\n\nUp ahead a private Konstantin didn't know began shouting and crying, screaming at the trees.

"We've.. agreed," Wrangel nodded towards Drozdovsky before continuing, "That the Army has a basis for removing you two from your seats, and that it's the best course of action to save Holy Russia. Now, go on - sign here and here." Skoblin and Levitov both begrudgingly signed the documents - it was two separate letters of resignation.

At one point a minister named Sergei Antonov in Vladivostok had to make several public appearances following the publishing of a pamphlet claiming him to be dead; executed at the hands of our police forces!\n\nYet as absurd as the propaganda is there is no denying its effectiveness. Any hopes that the riots were ceasing have died, and the police are continuing to struggle with the now nightly unruliness across the region."
rus.81.a:0 "Organize Japanese volunteers to remove these filthy lies!"
rus.82.t:0 "The Power of Words"
rus.82.d:0 "Pavel limped through the door, let out a deep sigh, and collapsed backwards into his favorite chair. His mother was asleep in the next room and he was sure she had heard him enter. When she did not emerge from her slumber, Pavel felt a slight guilt. Today was the third day in a row he had gone “protesting” with his coworkers at the dockyards. Each time Pavel was disobeying her; that underpaid woman who sought only to protect their family. He understood her reluctance. Government reprisal descending upon their tiny apartment was the last thing baby Isaak needed.\n\nWhat she didn't understand was that he was protecting Isaak too. It was true Pavel held his own righteous fury at the Japanese, however he was not merely selfish. The real origin of all his actions was hope. He hoped desperately that the future might be better for his little brother, for he could not bear to see that child grow up under foreign domination when they were so close to the Motherland’s border.\n\nIsaak shook his head dejectedly. It was the third night in a row, his bones ached and his muscles cried out as a result of his earlier flight from the police, and he was exhausted. They had all chanted slogans, organised rallies  and thrown bricks through windows. He had even encountered men with rifles firing towards their occupiers. A sinking feeling gripped him as his early tenacity wavered. How could such a disorganized movement triumph over the Japanese? The people held so much rage in their hearts and yet it had only been expressed in a chaotic frenzy.\n\nHe stood up stiffly and grunted despite his body demanding sleep. Pavel needed to clear his head, so the scarf slipped back on and he descended the steps. However, just as he was going to turn towards the exterior door a leaflet caught his eye. He turned it in his palm and opened the folds. Inside, in bold RUSt was the word “MURDERERS!” accompanied by a picture of the local minister Sergei Antonov. He devoured the words, hearing the tale of brutal savagery inflicted upon the poor Russian. Suddenly the tiredness and aches were gone. He glanced at the clock upon the wall above him and squinted his eyes.\n\nFor Sergei, Pavel could afford a few more hours at the dockyard."

rus.95.t:0 "A Second Sun in St.Petersburg"
rus.95.d:0 "The Razor’s gash went deep, drawing bright red fluid from Dimitri’s chin. It ran like water upon glass and dribbled to the floor. Dimitri didn’t even notice. Two fists gripped the sides of the sink and wide eyes stared ahead in the mirror. In the background he heard the shouts and cries. He had no doubt of the scene’s carnage. He guessed half of the men were praying and the other half was beating those that were for cowardice. They hadn’t even reached the front yet and men were probably dead.\n\nHalf shaven but finally aware Dimitri ran from the bathroom to confirm his suspicions. The Barracks was empty save a single sleeping man. Dimitri thought of waking him before deciding against it. If it was really happening, best he stayed that way.\n\nOutside now. The Officers were pounding upon the headquarters of their superior a few meters away. A particularly angry one could be heard yelling even from where he stood. \n\n“You said our progress had been swift enough!”\n\nHis eyes turned from the officer to the sky and felt surreal as the streak made its long arc. His terror was replaced with laughter. It had only taken seconds for every aspiration to vanish. Memento Mori.\n\nHis pupils burned in an instant, alongside the rest of St.Petersburg."
rus.95.a:0 "Today, there is a second sun..."
rus.90.t:0 "The Crown of St.George"
rus.90.d:0 "Wrangel sighed, rubbed his temples, and quietly chuckled. Looking at the big picture, it really was quite funny in that absurd sort of way. He let the telephone drop to the desk, dial tone and all. He had thought the madness was over, that God’s toying had ceased. It had been his duty to seize Russia from those spoiled children, pretenders who let the nation fall to anarchy in the interest of saving their own skin. The leader of Russia rarely held the same face for long, and he intended to stabilise it.\n\n Now as the footsteps in the hallway grew louder and louder, he realised it had all been for nothing. Drozdovsky was himself but a foolish child despite his advanced age. Pytor was the only adult left in Russia. Though he knew it sinful, in such a moment, he thought only of retiring to his dacha. “You Win” he said cynically with an added “screeching brats” under his breath.\n\n The doors opened on cue, and with them came the pointed barrels. He addressed Drozdovodgosky only, the apathy obvious in his voice.\n\n “Tell me Mikhail Gordeevich, was it the land reform or the proposed constitution?”\n\n Pyotr left before truly receiving an answer, confident his days were numbered. It seemed Drozdovsky was more nostalgic than he had previously thought.. All the carnage since 1914 would now be entirely pointless; a cosmic joke. Absolute Czarism had returned from  hiatus, and Wrangel could not bear it, god forgive him."
rus.90.a:0 "God saves the country"
rus.100.t:0 "Moscow Calling"
rus.100.d:0 "“Sir, please confirm that order”\n\nThe General hated everything about it. He sat in a tomb, a sprawling mess of bulkheads and dimly lit tunnels full of stale air. Above was the dredging of barbarous hordes, hordes that held once great cities like Berlin, Paris, and Rome in their grip. His family was among the throng of citizens soon to be subjected to their whims. How he longed for elsewhere, to be fighting valiantly with rifle in hand while clearing a path for his wife and children. That was how men lived. Men were not rats who cowered in sewer systems.\n\n“Confirmed. You are to initiate the launch sequence” he spoke firmly.\n\n“Roger that sir. Sequence started.” \n\nThe General rubbed his eyes wearily while awaiting the opportunity to begin the next step. The whole thing made no damn sense with the enemy at the gates. Troops were made to obey orders and one order was all it should have taken.\n\n The inexplicable sense that eyes were upon him suddenly dawned again. The General slightly corrected his posture and glanced around the room. It's center consisted of a long circular table filled by men with little steel pins across their breast. Of all those men, he had the “honor” of answering the phone.\n\nAt the other end was the Vohzd, a towering figure who had become somewhat human in the last few hours spent caged together. The General hadn’t lost any respect for his leader though, In fact it had doubled. To see that such vision was capable of being carried out by a mere mortal was an inspiring thought.\n\nHis eyes glanced towards the stooge to his right, the one who seemed to be having trouble lighting a cigarette. It was shaky hands, badly concealed. The General wanted to laugh but stifled it before offering a light."

No more, the chains are broken, Britain is a nation once more."

ENG_french_rivalry:0 "French Rivalry - Low Hostility"
ENG_french_rivalry_desc:0 "Socialism is not an altar of which we are to die on, but the moving heart of the people. The arrogance of Paris would tell us otherwise and it's their right to do so, but in fair Britannia, we have a certain way of doing things. While the French dominated Internationale tolerates Britains path to Socialism thus far,\n§RThis policy might change in the future, brining about troublesome times§"
ENG_food_import:0 "Food Import Dependency"
ENG_food_import_desc:0 "Our glorious revolution have put an end to the ruthless colonial regime over 2 decades ago, but with the loss of the colonies, although unavoidable and righteous, came damage to the homeland, especially in the field of agriculture. The homeland have lost agricultural self sustainability many years ago, and with the loss of cheap imports from the colonies, it became reliant on food imports from France and other allies, which puts a strain on our economy."

In this return to the countryside campaign, British Youth shall be sent to the countryside, where they will learn of their land and aid the aging farming communities, giving them a breath of youthfulness and much needed help.

By investing into expansion of the Fishing Industry and introduction of modern methods to it on a large scale, we can provide the British People with this nutritious food in plenty, and fortify our independence from foreign sources. Such rapid expansion might upset some of our reactionary neighbors who disproportionately exploit our Seas, but Britain is a proud nation and shall not be afraid of what those backwards ants think."

By making production the collective effort of many workers each speciallized in their own work, instead of each repeating the whole process individually, you can achieve much greater efficiency in production. And we shall do! By speciallizing each worker in their task and investing into further specific education as to master it completely, the whole of society will benefit.

ENG.2.t:0 "Cambridge University Riot"
ENG.2.d:0 "What began as a simple act of vandalism in a Cambridge pub has grown into a national incident within the Union of Britain, one that is rapidly spiraling out of control! This morning, following the arrest of two students belonging to the local "Youth for Workplace Democracy" organization for their involvement in defacing property, massive protests gripped Cambridge university.\n\n Demanding the immediate release of both students,  greater freedom of expression and more democracy in both education and the workplace, the student body has almost overwhelmingly turned out in support of their ideas.\n\nRiot police, supplemented by Revolutionary Guard units arrived around 10am in an attempt to disperse the crowds. However, these efforts have only made the situation more dire, as protests turn to riots, local roads are blocked off, and stories of bloody noses and jeering shouts spill into the city itself. Authorities are preparing an escalated responses and the nation watches with weary eyes. Might this be a moment to remember? "
ENG.2.a:0 "Youngsters these days!"
ENG.3.t:0 "The Engilish Socialists support the protestors"
ENG.3.d:0 "Political disaster has overtaken the British Government! Following the failed negotiation, major representatives of the English-Socialist faction have declared a universal withdrawal from the Trade Union Congress.\n\nChief among grievances voiced by faction representatives was the continuing violent crackdown upon protesting students and workers in cities across northern England. Now, both common card carriers as well as representatives themselves can be seen manning the very same barricades in cities like Cambridge.\n\n Faith in the government and the Chairman have been irreparably damaged, and the TUC has been left scrambling to fill the void left by the loss of a pillar of British politics. Many wonder if the situation might escalate further, should the government take action against those unions that have withdrawn."
ENG.3.a:0 "Arrest all their leaders"
ENG.3.b:0 "We can't risk it"
ENG.4.t:0 "Workers Revolutionary Council of Britain"
ENG.4.d:0 "The situation in the Union of Britain has descended into barbarism of continued strikes, crackdowns, riots, followed the failed round of negotiation! In light of the government's failure to resolve the situation, students and union representatives have stopped short of an outright violent revolution and declared a new government in Birmingham;The Workers Revolutionary Council.\n\n While only officially intended to coordinate actions between protestors, few hold illusions that this body is anything but a dual power government to contest London's authority. Violent struggle with Revolutionary Guard and Police units has already erupted, and the city of Birmingham has effectively seceded from the Union. Accusations of Russian sabotage, tyranny by the Chairman, and partisan reprisals fly wild. The British Isles await with bated breath, surrounded in fortresses of overturned cars and streetside bariccades"
ENG.4.a:0 "We must resume the negotiation before this get worse"
ENG.4.b:0 "Crush them now!"
ENG.5.t:0 "The Great National Strike"
ENG.5.d:0 "Today, the British people create history. For months now the world has watched the "British Situation" build and build. Today, it has reached a crescendo. Climactic street battles and failed negotiations have culminated in a massive "All Britain General Strike" in which the entire economy has ground to a screeching halt. Workers, Bureaucrats and Students alike chant together from London to Glasgow, and the red flag flies from all corners. In addition, Foreign and a few domestic presses are printing in support of the movement.\n\n Many are drawing nervous comparisons to the 1925 revolution itself, and it seems that the Mosley government is effectively dead. A new era is sure to begin soon…"

Oswald Mosley; the grand protector of the Union of Britain, saviour of the revolution, terror in the night, and the black sheep of the socialist bloc, is no more. Faced with a paralyzed economy and a population on the brink of civil war, the Chairman finally yielded. Mosley has resigned from his post, taking his entire cabinet with him.\n\nWith the conclusion of what is now being dubbed internationally as the "Second Glorious Revolution"a struggle for power immediately erupted between more radical leftists based in Birmingham, and the English Socialist militias.\n\nAlliances were made and broken, frenzied sporadic shootouts ended in bloodshed, and rapid arrests were carried out. As the dust settles,  the victor has become clear; The English Socialists have assumed control of the Union of Britain.\n\nDespite the efforts of vain radicals to coerce the English people into erasure of their own identity, the English Socialists have triumphed. The soul of England remains safe, and the unique character of the British revolution has been preserved. Promising sanity, stability, and an end to the Mosleyite Kleptocracy,  Minister Blair would surely be heartened by this outcome, where he was around to see it himself."
ENG.7.a:0 "The long, long night is over"
ENG.6.t:0 "The WRC Seized Government"
ENG.6.d:0 "The chaos so long strangling the Union of Britain has come to an end. Across the country, millions shed tears, and millions more rejoice. Oswald Mosley; the grand protector of the Union of Britain, saviour of the revolution, terror in the night,  and the black sheep of the socialist bloc, is no more. Faced with a paralyzed economy and a population on the brink of civil war, the chairman finally yielded. Mosley has resigned from his post, taking his entire cabinet with him.\n\nWith the conclusion of  what is now being dubbed internationally as the "Second Revolution", representatives of the English Socialist faction made swift moves to secure power and stability. However, this action quickly proved ineffective, as it became apparent that the rabble was unwilling to accept any remnant of the old order.\n\nThus, the rival government formed in Birmingham known as the "Workers Revolutionary Council" has stepped in to fill the vacuum with its militia. Promising to "complete what was started in 1925" It seems a true proletarian revolution is here to stay, casting down all remnants of the bourgeois society. Finally, the British worker will control his own destiny! Finally, the torch of liberty shines bright over Britain!"

The people of Britain are behind their dream, the dream that was formed by my father in the fateful days of 1937, a Britain glorious and free, freed from the shackles of poverty and fear, my father has promised you: win the war and the world will be ours. But the people was not ready then, the war was still taking its toll on our people and we missed our chance to turn its fiery fire into a new revolution, the Comrade Chairman heard the voices of the people and we have waited but now, now is the hour and now is the time. We, the soldiers, the hero-workers can not wait any longer before the fire of our unique opportunity for national mobilisation to pass away, thus I call upon the ministers of the state, the civil servants, glorious workers and farmers, our brother-in-arms still fulfilling the honourable internationalist duty across Europe, I call this upon you: Unite! Unite! Let’s us go forward as crusading regiments, armed with the fervent spirit for righteousness to reign forever on earth!""
Uob.1.a:0 "Glory to New Britain, Glory to its Heroes"
Uob.2.t:0 "A Nation of Coal and Steel" 
Uob.2.d:0 "When the first machines were built in our great nation to thresh wheat and cotton, a new age dawned over the road. The old consensus, one of simple, slow production in quaint villages in sleep nations led by Fabulously wealthy monarchs who deliberately distanced themselves from the unwashed masses was decimated. Factories, where the products of a new machine age were made blossomed like flowers across our nation. These factories needed fuel, so thus deep mines were tunneled into the bosom of the earth to tear coal from its depths. \n\nMuch blood, many tears, limbs great and small and ever great torrents of sweat were shed so that Britain could advance into the modern, mercantile age. A great empire was built from mechanical foundations. Of course, that age overstayed its welcome, and eventually, after wars to ensure that age’s survival, Britain was justly and gloriously painted Red.\n\nSince the revolution, Britain has only grown more and more industrial. Great factories were built to make up for the loss of the Empire, coming to become a net exporter of manufactured goods for the European Socialist Republics, and after the Second World War, all of Western Europe. The Second World War greatly expanded British industry on the military level as well, with British armaments being the central line of attack of anti-reactionary rebels across the world. Our coal fuels Europe, showing the power of Socialism even from Space itself!""

Uob.3.a:0 "The English way of life is the best way of life"
Uob.4.t:0 "The Fields of Britain" 
Uob.4.d:0 "Despite the Industrialization of Britain, our national consciousness is still imbued with the Shires and fields of this nation; from the hilly North to the flat and reedy lands of Cornwall. During the time of Chairman Mosley, Britain saw many state-sponsored poet whimsical talk of the great green land as it was increasingly rolled back for the rising industrial base. Rural folk have been dismissed as yokels, relics of a bygone era, while the great historical landmarks of the country have become dusty and forgotten.\n\nNo longer! Chairman Mosley and his administration have collectively decided that the rural areas of the nation shall be given much more attention. *Real* attention, not just some poets waxing lyrically or some token packages. Farmers shall be given new subsidies, Dying communities shall be given economic tonics they have so desperately needed for so long, while some rural repatriation shall be encouraged.\n\nThe general non-rural population shall also be included in this endeavor. Agricultural drafts have been proposed for years, and they have been advocated as a good old fashioned way to teach the youth hard work and make the “urban folk” feel the soil of their ancestors."
Uob.4.a:0 "Seems pretty good!"
Uob.5.t:0 "Towards Food Self Sufficiency" 
Uob.5.d:0 "In order for the union to stand strong we must sometimes rely on others but for such a vital resource such as wheat and grain we sohuld be able to hold our own, we will move the union towards food self sufficiency"

Uob.6.a:0 "Tracks must be built"
Uob.7.t:0 "A National Bourgeoisie" 
Uob.7.d:0 "The economy of the Union of Britain has long been built upon the economic principles of Syndicalism; a Socialist branch built upon Labour Unions and Co-operative businesses. Long the dominant strand of social and economic development, Chairman Mosley has over the course of is administration begun moving against this model, centralizing economic organs towards his new and reformed ministries This move has been proven to be the correct one time and time again; from the needs of mass mobilization in the Second World War to the postwar reconstruction initiatives to the needs of all of Europe.\n\nNowadays, the European economy has grown even more ravenous and “needy” as the European economies mostly recover from the hardship inflicted by the War years.With Britain becoming the Industrial heartland of the Socialist order in Europe, the responsibility of the Socialist economies requires we get creative and perhaps break down some orthodoxies.\n\nThus, Chairman Mosley and his allies have hashed out a basic plan to renovate the economy to meet new demands and aid our own economic development. Known officially as the “Economic development initiative of 1952”, the plan involves re-introducing some Market aspects to our economies, along with creating a controlled “National Bourgeoisie” class to oversee these changes. As such, this plan has been colloquially termed the “National Bourgeoisie plan”.Of course, none of these reforms will change the fundamental aspects of the Socialist state, and this new class shall always be accountable to the Working men and women of Britain."

Uob.9.d:0 "Comrade Grand Protector Mosley’s New Britain plan has officially entered its sixteenth year; and what glorious years they have been! So much has improved since the early revolutionary era. Our industry has grown to great heights, not even dreamed of under capitalism and shocking even the greatest advocates of industrialization in the Socialist world. Our Agriculture has begun to order itself, with co-operatives and private landholdings growing ever more productive every year.\n\nEven culturally, our nation has improved. The average Briton can quote Shakespeare and other famous playwrights by heart, as government funded acting troupes criss-cross the nation. Restaurants serve elaborate meals with simple ingredients, sourced directly from our isles. "

ENG.9.t:0 "The Death of Eric Blair"
ENG.9.d:0 "The night had been long and fraught, full of coughing fits and arguments over correct preparation of tea. It had been a cacophony of regret, shouting, reflection, when all was said and done, Love.\n\nEric came in and out of consciousness throughout, a wry smile covering his face. A passive observer, he simply watched the crowd of  friends and family that danced around the room before him.  After all his years as minister,  in the thick of impassioned debates, He wouldn't have had it any other way. It wasn't until around 4am, when the rabble finally fell quiet that  all eyes turned to Blair. He cleared his throat, and a small croak escaped his lips.\n\n"Anglican, please let it be Anglican.."\n\nAs the morning birds began to chirp on the green hills, Eric Blair finally fell into a deep sleep. Quiet sobs gripped the room, only broken by a few stoic friends from the service. Though he was not born upon the isles, Blair felt boundless love for England. In the end, it had returned the favour. He breathed his last, and his body went limp. So was the end of an era."

ENG.10.a:0 "England awaits her victors"
ENG.11.t:0 "Elections Begin!"
ENG.11.d:0 "Once again, the people of Britain turn out for the hallowed tradition of Democratic election. Candidates from numerous factions jockey for the favor of the people, promising everything from better roads to less farm regulation. Three primary factions have emerged, the National Labourites, the Maximalists and the English Socialists, all with their own unique ideas as to how to improve the Union and aid the position of the average Briton.\n\nNational Labour is a faction of moderate Labourites, reduced to a mere junior partner in Mosley’s power sharing pact after its failure in 1937. This faction supports economic liberalization, reducing state intervention and freer markets. Although rumor says that if they win the 1950 election, it would certainly not a victory made by the National Labour’s popularity but form a cabinet of mostly Mosley’s yes-man yet again.\n\nThe English Socialists are neither too radical nor too moderate, yet calling for a revolution of their own, inspired by a patriotic and romantic vision of the English way of life. This faction priotizes agricultural development as it is the measure for England's food dependency problem. Another point would be its total opposition to pacifism, this faction favours rapid armement for British home defense and power projection. Despite supporting Mosley in many ways, this faction mostly commits itself to the principles of Democracy. However there were doubts that after their electoral victory in the Mosley’s Democracy, only a moderate cabinet of lesser voices can take power, being a certain Hugh Dalton.\n\nThe Mosleyites are supporters of the "Grand Protector's" distinct, if highly unorthodox and repressive, vision for England. This faction represents Mosley's personal gambit to remain in power, and is a decently likely winner of any election to come. Should the chairman win once again, it is expected that he will further cement his control."

ENG.12.t:0 "National Labourites Win Election"
ENG.12.d:0 "A shocking result has emerged from the British elections. The National Labouritte faction has emerged victorious by the narrowest of margins. Espousing a moderate line, they seek to keep Mosley’s policies “sane” and “measured”, while not descending into fanaticism. Strangely enough, they also seek some rollbacks of the Mosleyite economic policies, a position which has certainly not immediately endeared them to many in the British public.\n\nGrand Protector Mosley has issued statements praising the smooth election and the newly elected representatives, proclaiming that ‘Their honesty and conscientiousness in the face of opposition is exactly what Britain needs now”. Meanwhile Malcolm MacDonald, the leader of the Labourites has congratulated the “good fight” of their opposition.\n\nBeing somewhat anti-Mosley in concept despite their obvious dependence and servitude to Mosley, it remains to be seen how they shall work with the current Mosley government."
ENG.12.a:0 "This wasn’t supposed to happe- I mean, Congratulations!"
ENG.13.t:0 "Maximalists Win Elections!"
ENG.13.d:0 "In a result that surprises absolutely no one, the faction aligned with Grand Protector Oswald Molsey has emerged triumphant in the recent elections in the Union of Britain. Thorough believers in the doctrines of Maximalism and Totalism, the Maximalists have vowed to continue Mosley’s policies and ideals, whatever the cost.\n\nGrand Protector Mosley has issued statements praising the smooth election and the newly elected representatives, proclaiming that ‘Their dedication and stalwartness in the face of opposition is exactly what Britain needs now”. Meanwhile, the Maximalists themselves have congratulated the “good fight” of their opposition.\n\n Being firm believers in Mosley’s ideals, the Maximalists will be excellent helmsmen in the eyes of the current regime, continuing the glorious revolution and its policies."

Romanticists opposed to French Marxian influence, they believe in the ideal of a Socialist England with a uniquely English Socialism. Not opposed to Mosley in any way,  they are also not slavish Maximalists and may oppose Mosley on some key issues.\n\nGrand Protector Mosley has issued statements praising the smooth election and the newly elected representatives, proclaiming that ‘Their idealism and Patriotism in the face of opposition is exactly what Britain needs now”. Meanwhile Hugh Dalton, the leader of the English Socialists has congratulated the “good fight” of their opposition.\n\nBeing somewhat anti-Mosley in concept despite their obvious dependence and servitude to Mosley, it remains to be seen how they shall work with the current Mosley government."

The homeland have lost agricultural self sustainability many years ago, and with the loss of cheap imports from the colonies, it became reliant on food imports from France and other allies, which puts a strain on our economy."
