 bulgarians.1.t:0 "Bulgaria wants to sign the Tripartite!"
 bulgarians.1.d:0 "Bulgaria has offered to sign the Tripartite Pact and join the Axis in an effort to help us in our goal of world domination."
 bulgarians.1.a:0 "Let them in."
 bulgarians.1.b:0 "We don't want them in!"
 bulgarians.2.t:0 "We are allowed in!"
 bulgarians.2.d:0 "Germany has allowed us to join the Axis Powers and with that, we formalised our alliance and signed the Tripartite Pact."
 bulgarians.2.a:0 "Hurray!"
 bulgarians.3.t:0 "They declined!"
 bulgarians.3.d:0 "The gruesome Germans have declined our request to join the Axis!"
 bulgarians.3.a:0 "The fools!"
 bulgarians.7.t:0 "The Drama Uprising"
 bulgarians.7.d:0 "As a response to our Bulgarisation process, the Greeks have risen up and rebelled against the country. Many valiant soldiers were lost in combat against them."
 bulgarians.7.a:0 "Damn them!"
 bulgarians.9.t:0 "Treaty with Bulgaria"
 bulgarians.9.d:0 "Bulgaria has requested that we support them in modernisation, and request that we aid them in researching planes for the Bulgarian airforce. This might drive them closer to us, and might be worth it in the long run."
 bulgarians.9.a:0 "What's the harm?"
 bulgarians.9.b:0 "What?! No!"
 bulgarians.10.t:0 "They agreed!"
 bulgarians.10.d:0 "The Italians agreed to help with our modernisation!"
 bulgarians.10.a:0 "Woo!"
 bulgarians.11.t:0 "They didn't agree!"
 bulgarians.11.d:0 "The Italians didn't agree to our research treaty! Eventually we shall teach them."
 bulgarians.11.a:0 "Bah, filth."
 bulgarians.12.t:0 "Bulgaria to join the Comintern?"
 bulgarians.12.d:0 "Bulgaria has requested to join the Comintern. They are a socialist state now and it might be beneficial to add them to our alliance."
 bulgarians.12.a:0 "Very well"
 bulgarians.12.b:0 "They are alone"
 bulgarians.13.t:0 "They accepted!"
 bulgarians.13.d:0 "We have been accepted into the Comintern. Together, the Soviet Brotherhood stands strong!"
 bulgarians.13.a:0 "Finally!"
 bulgarians.14.t:0 "They declined!"
 bulgarians.14.d:0 "We have been declined membership to the Comintern. This only makes them a target of Greater Bulgaria."
 bulgarians.14.a:0 "Outrageous!"
 bulgarians.15.t:0 "The Balkan Federation"
 bulgarians.15.d:0 "Bulgaria has offered that we join a faction with them based on our shared ideologies. It might be good, as this would prove that the Balkans can actually be united."
 bulgarians.15.a:0 "Seems fair."
 bulgarians.15.b:0 "I think not."
 bulgarians.16.t:0 "Yugoslavia agreed!"
 bulgarians.16.d:0 "Yugoslavia has agreed to our concept of a united Balkans. A Communist community in the Balkans is a great idea anyway, and anyone who says otherwise is foolish."
 bulgarians.16.a:0 "Woo!"
 bulgarians.17.t:0 "Yugoslavia declined!"
 bulgarians.17.d:0 "The Yugoslavians declined our idea for a united Balkans! The fools! We should show them!"
 bulgarians.17.a:0 "The fools!"
 bulgarians.18.t:0 "Bulgaria demands Thrace!"
 bulgarians.18.d:0 "Bulgaria has demanded their old territory of Thrace. While they formerly owned it after the First Balkan War, Thrace is now obviously Greek! However, appeasement might be a good call."
 bulgarians.18.a:0 "Give it up."
 bulgarians.18.b:0 "Thrace is Greek!"
 bulgarians.19.t:0 "Greece Accepted!"
 bulgarians.19.d:0 "The Greeks have accepted our demands for Thrace. They must realise that they are an inferior power compared to us."
 bulgarians.19.a:0 "Good."
 bulgarians.20.t:0 "The Greeks Declined!"
 bulgarians.20.d:0 "The Greeks have declined our demands for territory! We should show them who has the real power here!"
 bulgarians.20.a:0 "Indeed we should."
 bulgarians.24.t:0 "Macedonian Uprising!"
 bulgarians.24.d:0 "The Macedonians have risen up against us! Our way of dealing with them was less effective than hoped, and now they have risen up against us. We dealt with them, but it costed us manpower that's not easily replaced. However, we made sure it would not happen again."
 bulgarians.24.a:0 "Fools!"
 bulgarians.25.t:0 "An agreement proposed!"
 bulgarians.25.d:0 "The Bulgarians have proposed an agreement. For the Bulgarians have a clean record of adhering to the effects of the peace treaty of the Great War. They may have redeemed themselves, and they might be a usefull ally."
 bulgarians.25.a:0 "Alright, fine."
 bulgarians.25.b:0 "What, no!"
 bulgarians.26.t:0 "Greece agreed!"
 bulgarians.26.d:0 "Good news! The Greeks have agreed to lift the restrictions placed upon our country. We can now finally start preparing our country for the upcoming conflict."
 bulgarians.26.a:0 "Victory!"
 bulgarians.27.t:0 "The Greeks disagreed!"
 bulgarians.27.d:0 "The obviously disillusioned government of Greece has disagreed to our rearmament! We must act on this! If we are to prepare our country, then we shall have to stop abiding by the peace treaty."
 bulgarians.27.a:0 "Then so we shall."
 bulgarians.28.t:0 "Bulgaria demands Dobrudja"
 bulgarians.28.d:0 "Bulgaria has demanded their former territory of Dobrudja. They formerly owned this territory after the First Balkan War, but gradually lost it when the Second Balkan War kicked off. It might be wise to appease them, although if we could destroy them before they become a threat, that would be good."
 bulgarians.28.a:0 "Give it back"
 bulgarians.28.b:0 "No, it's ours!"
 bulgarians.29.t:0 "Romania agrees!"
 bulgarians.29.d:0 "Romania has agreed to give us back Dobrudja, the territory we lost after the events of the Great War. We should use this opportunity."
 bulgarians.29.a:0 "Hay!"
 bulgarians.30.t:0 "Romania declined!"
 bulgarians.30.d:0 "The Romanians have declined our demand for Dobrudja! We should teach them not to oppose us!"
 bulgarians.30.a:0 "Damnation!"
 bulgarians.30.b:0 "Ask the Germans"
 bulgarians.30.c:0 "Never mind, give up"

 bulgarian_news.1.t:0 "The Bulgarians signed the Tripartite Pact!"
 bulgarian_news.1.d:0 "Today, the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry announced that they had formally signed the Tripartite Pact with the German Reich, formalising their military and economic ties with them. The minister was cited as giving it as a result of growing tension in the region in order to defend Bulgarian sovereignty.  /n/nWhilst this might be the official statement, many in the international scene see this as a more aggressive move in line with more revanchist policies."
 bulgarian_news.1.a:0 "Well then"
 bulgarian_news.1.b:0 "Hay!"
 bulgarian_news.1.c:0 "A toast to the Bulgarians!"
 bulgarian_news.2.t:0 "Bulgaria joins the Comintern!"
 bulgarian_news.2.d:0 "Bulgaria has joined the Comintern and decided to reinforce their Slavic brothers in the potential conflicts to come."
 bulgarian_news.2.a:0 "Fair enough."
 bulgarian_news.2.b:0 "Woohoo!"
 bulgarian_news.2.c:0 "Welcome, comrades!"
 bulgarian_news.4.t:0 "Tsar Boris III dies!"
 bulgarian_news.4.d:0 "Tsar Boris the Third of Bulgaria has tragically died from heart failure today. Formally, Simeon II, Boris' son, would take over the tsardom, but being not of age, Boris' brother, Prince Kiril of Preslav, took over command of the country."
 bulgarian_news.4.a:0 "Oh well"
 bulgarian_news.5.t:0 "Tsar Boris survives alleged assassination"
 bulgarian_news.5.d:0 "According to the Bulgarian news papers, Tsar Boris had survived an attempt of assassination, allegedly planned by Germany to dispose of the tsar."
 bulgarian_news.5.a:0 "Allegedly? Hm.."
 bulgarian_news.6.t:0 "Restrictions upon Bulgaria lifted!"
 bulgarian_news.6.d:0 "The Greek government has agreed to the rearmament of the Bulgarian military. After the Great War, Bulgaria has been limited in its military efforts and production. Bulgaria has a record of abiding to them however, which convinced the Greeks that the effects should be lifted."
 bulgarian_news.6.a:0 "If they deem it wise.."
 bulgarian_news.6.b:0 "... Yeah, thanks.."

 bulgariansenhanced.1.t:0 "Bulgaria requests German arms!"
 bulgariansenhanced.1.d:0 "Bulgaria, in their effort to rearm themselves, has requested our support. The Bulgarians say that the British have allowed them to rearm freely, citing the instability in the region as their reasoning. Now the Bulgarians request that we send them a few thousand guns to help them in rearming. Agreeing would develop our relations with the Bulgarians but they could just as easily stab us in the back and side with the enemy, we should carefully consider our options."
 bulgariansenhanced.1.a:0 "Very well, help them."
 bulgariansenhanced.1.b:0 "They're on their own."
 bulgariansenhanced.2.t:0 "The Germans agreed!"
 bulgariansenhanced.2.d:0 "The Germans have agreed to our request for aid in rearming. We have been given two-thousand guns to help us along. Obviously, we should compensate them! Or we could use the guns and never look at them again, it's a lottery."
 bulgariansenhanced.2.a:0 ".. Yeah."
 bulgariansenhanced.3.t:0 "The Germans declined!"
 bulgariansenhanced.3.d:0 "The Germans have declined our most generous request for supplies! We only requested two-thousand guns, and they can definitely spare the guns. Damn them!"
 bulgariansenhanced.3.a:0 "What! Filth!"
 bulgariansenhanced.4.t:0 "Bulgarian Friendship?"
 bulgariansenhanced.4.d:0 "Bulgaria has suggested that we sign a Treaty of friendship with them, to be labeled the Treaty of Eternal Friendship. The Bulgarians want to improve relations with us, now this is obviously a trap, but going along with it might actually be fruitful for us."
 bulgariansenhanced.4.a:0 "Sign it!"
 bulgariansenhanced.4.b:0 "How about.. no."
 bulgariansenhanced.5.t:0 "Yugoslavia agreed!"
 bulgariansenhanced.5.d:0 "The Yugoslavs agreed to our Treaty of Eternal Friendship! I figure they realise that we actually are their friends! Well, they think we are, but we know better."
 bulgariansenhanced.5.a:0 "Hay!"
 bulgariansenhanced.6.t:0 "Yugoslavia declined!"
 bulgariansenhanced.6.d:0 "The Yugoslavs have declined our Treaty of Eternal Friendship! How could they?! Do they not realise that we've changed? The fools! We should teach them!"
 bulgariansenhanced.6.a:0 "How unfortunate."
 bulgariansenhanced.7.t:0 "Georgi Kyoseivanov resigns!"
 bulgariansenhanced.7.d:0 "The Prime Minister resigns! Prime minister Kyoseivanov, who has led the country since 1935, has officially resigned from service! Now we could install a successor, which would be Bogdan Filov, an ally of Tsar Boris himself! Or we could dissolve Kyoseivanov's government entirely and install Boris III as our leader, considering, he is. We'd be installing a government handpicked by Boris himself."
 bulgariansenhanced.7.a:0 "Filov it is."
 bulgariansenhanced.7.b:0 "Long live the Tsar!"
 bulgariansenhanced.8.t:0 "Fatherland Front empowered!"
 bulgariansenhanced.8.d:0 "Our attempt to empower the Fatherland Front has paid off! The Fatherland Front just became the majority party of the government and they've officially taken control. Tsar Boris is still in power but no longer in direct control. Now to hope that the Fatherland Front can steer us away from Germany's side and on the Soviet side."
 bulgariansenhanced.8.a:0 "Hay!"
 bulgariansenhanced.9.t:0 "Entry to the Balkan Pact?"
 bulgariansenhanced.9.d:0 "Bulgaria has requested entry to the Balkan Entente as an affiliate state. This means we'll guarantee them our aid if anyone goes to war with Bulgaria. Naturally, when someone does go to war with them, we can just abandon them, although this'll cost us our reputation. Of course we can also decide not to guarantee them and we'll be off fine."
 bulgariansenhanced.9.a:0 "Welcome them in!"
 bulgariansenhanced.9.b:0 "They're on their own."
 bulgariansenhanced.10.t:0 "They said no!"
 bulgariansenhanced.10.d:0 "Those bloody Romanians rejected our request! We're not allowed into the Balkan Entente! This is maddening! We should take revenge, and shoot them, or something. They can't be allowed to do this."
 bulgariansenhanced.10.a:0 "What!"
 bulgariansenhanced.11.t:0 "Bulgarians wish to negotiate!"
 bulgariansenhanced.11.d:0 "It seems the Bulgarian government has finally realised that they're on the losing side of this war, rather late, might I add. We will obviously be compensated for this. That aside, it's now time for us to decide their fate. Either they'll become our ally against the Germans and join the Comintern, or we'll leave them to be crushed by the Soviet might."
 bulgariansenhanced.11.a:0 "Yeah alright."
 bulgariansenhanced.11.b:0 "Kill!"
 bulgariansenhanced.12.t:0 "They agreed!"
 bulgariansenhanced.12.d:0 "The Soviet have agreed to let us into the Comintern! Now we'll be fighting on the good side, and we might gain something out of this too! But now, we should focus on the fighting with Nazi Germany, and make the Soviets proud."
 bulgariansenhanced.12.a:0 "Mila Rodino Bulgaria!"
 bulgariansenhanced.13.t:0 "The Soviets declined"
 bulgariansenhanced.13.d:0 "The Soviets have declined our offer! Our attempt at survival with the Soviets has failed. Now we should do all we can to survive on the side of the Germans. We should make them proud, but more importantly, make our country and our people proud."
 bulgariansenhanced.13.a:0 "Damnation!"
 bulgariansenhanced.14.t:0 "Bulgaria wants to re-affirm the Balkan Entente!"
 bulgariansenhanced.14.d:0 "The current system that is the Balkan Entente seems to have fallen out of practise. Our allies will not help us in a war unless we bind them by treaty. Maybe this is actually a good idea. On the other hand, if we want to step away from the Balkans, we should probably not re-affirm it."
 bulgariansenhanced.14.a:0 "Found it! Send out the invites!"
 bulgariansenhanced.14.b:0 "Nah."
 bulgariansenhanced.15.t:0 "The Romanians agreed!"
 bulgariansenhanced.15.d:0 "The Romanians have agreed to re-affirming the Balkan Entente. We've been invited as an honoured member, and should Romania prove incapable of leading the alliance any further, that role should fall to us. With that said, the other members of the Balkan Entente have also been invited to re-affirm the Balkan Entente. They probably realise that the current system is really broken anyway, so we'll be good."
 bulgariansenhanced.15.a:0 "Oh hey!"
 bulgariansenhanced.16.t:0 "The Romanians hate us!"
 bulgariansenhanced.16.d:0 "Okay maybe too dramatic, they probably don't hate us. However, they will not re-affirm the Balkan Entente. It is probably safe to assume that they're looking to lash out on their own. Or they do truly hate us and the other members of the Balkan Entente. One or the other. Either way, now there are two of them."
 bulgariansenhanced.16.a:0 "Two of them? What?"
 bulgariansenhanced.17.t:0 "The Albanian Inheritance"
 bulgariansenhanced.17.d:0 "The Bulgarians have demanded that we become their puppet, citing that our territory was supposedly the territory of one of their former empires. Naturally, we don't remember any of this. However, the Bulgarians outsize us by far, and there's only a slim chance that we'll be able to defeat them if they come invading us. It might be feasible to become their puppet and gain our independence back, although if you're faithful, by all means, go ahead and decline."
 bulgariansenhanced.17.a:0 "Yeah alright let's go"
 bulgariansenhanced.17.b:0 "I'm faithful!"
 bulgariansenhanced.18.t:0 "They agreed."
 bulgariansenhanced.18.d:0 "The Albanians realised that we're right, and they have accepted us as their legitimate overlords. Now, we should peacefully integrate Albania into Greater Bulgaria. They are just one step towards making our nation great again."
 bulgariansenhanced.18.a:0 "Bam."
 bulgariansenhanced.19.t:0 "They declined!"
 bulgariansenhanced.19.d:0 "The foolish Albanians have declined our request to become our puppet! Do they not realise that their territory is ours by right? What's wrong with them?! We should seize their territory with immediate effect! They disrespect the greater Bulgarian Empire!"
 bulgariansenhanced.19.a:0 "Attack!"
 bulgariansenhanced.20.t:0 "The Romanians agreed!"
 bulgariansenhanced.20.d:0 "The Romanians have agreed to our request of partnership with the Balkan Entente. If somebody goes to war with us now, the Romanians should come to our aid, hopefully. Now we should evolve this into a functional alliance, between us, Romania, and the other members of the Balkan Entente."
 bulgariansenhanced.20.a:0 "Woo!"
 bulgariansenhanced.21.t:0 "The Bulgarians Request We Act As Meditators for Southern Dobrudja"
 bulgariansenhanced.21.d:0 "Following a wave of nationalism and revanchism in Bulgaria over the land they lost in the Great War, the Bulgarian ambassador to Germany today requested that we conclude the future of the region. The Bulgarians claim that it was robbed off them in the Second Balkan War, and it has an ethnic majority of Bulgarians."
 bulgariansenhanced.21.a:0 "We understand what it is like to lose rightful land."
 bulgariansenhanced.21.b:0 "The Romanians will serve us as a better ally."
 bulgariansenhanced.22.t:0 "The Germans Demand We Cede South Dobrogea"
 bulgariansenhanced.22.d:0 "It would seem the Bulgarians, too cowardly to fight us on their own, have licked the boots of their former master in the Great War to attempt to seize Romanian lands. Whilst we might be able to fight the Bulgarians, the threat of German invasion remains a lingering factor."
 bulgariansenhanced.22.a:0 "Why die for Dobrogea?"
 bulgariansenhanced.22.b:0 "Rather we die than dishonour ourselves."
 bulgariansenhanced.23.t:0 "The Germans Refuse to Help"
 bulgariansenhanced.23.d:0 "Despite the fact that Germany too suffered injustices of land stolen in treaties enforced, they refuse to aid us in our rightful reacquisition of land, claiming they do not intend to upset the Balkan power balance."
 bulgariansenhanced.23.a:0 "Nonsense. If you want something done properly.."
 bulgariansenhanced.24.t:0 "Romania Cedes Dobrubja"
 bulgariansenhanced.24.d:0 "Jubliant scenes across Bulgaria and the reclaimed lands as the Romanians cede the territory they stole from us. We have agreed to exchange populations with them under German observation. This is the first step to returning to our rightful position."
 bulgariansenhanced.24.a:0 "One injustice removed, more to come."
 bulgariansenhanced.25.t:0 "The Romanians Refuse to Cede Southern Dobrudja."
 bulgariansenhanced.25.d:0 "Despite influence from the Germans and the rightful position the territory has in Bulgaria, the dastardly Romanians once again deny us and the Prussians from our right. Words have failed us, but we are not exhausted for options."
 bulgariansenhanced.25.a:0 "Let us put the Romanians in their place."
 bulgariansenhanced.26.t:0 "The Bulgarians Present a Partition of Yugoslavia"
 bulgariansenhanced.26.d:0 "Our Bulgarian friends in the Balkans present a solution to deal with the artificial state of Yugoslavia. A nation born out of cruel treaties, it seems only right to end it. They state that upon an invasion of Yugoslavia, they will move into Macedonia as they did in 1915, and the Slavs will be crushed in days."
 bulgariansenhanced.26.a:0 "Another humiliation of the Great War undone."
 bulgariansenhanced.26.b:0 "We share land with nobody!"
 bulgariansenhanced.27.t:0 "The Germans Accept the Partition"
 bulgariansenhanced.27.d:0 "The Germans see the sense in our plan, and agree to help eliminate the failed state of Yugoslavia and return what is rightfully ours."
 bulgariansenhanced.27.a:0 "A toast to our old German Allies!"
 bulgariansenhanced.28.t:0 "The Germans Refuse the Partition"
 bulgariansenhanced.28.d:0 "The Germans, as if their low character was the subject of Greek plays, have refused to aid us in our reclamation of what is Bulgarian land occupied by the Serbians. We stand alone as we did when we were betrayed by the Balkan League all those years ago."
 bulgariansenhanced.28.a:0 "Alone, but not weak."
 bulgariansenhanced.29.t:0 "Honour the Bulgarian Agreement?"
 bulgariansenhanced.29.d:0 "Yugoslavia is under our control, as is Macedonia. Should we honour our agreement to the Bulgarians and cede Macedonia to them, or keep it for ourselves?"
 bulgariansenhanced.29.a:0 "Yes, they will serve as a valuable ally."
 bulgariansenhanced.29.b:0 "No, we have other plans."
 bulgariansenhanced.30.t:0 "The Germans Return Macedonia"
 bulgariansenhanced.30.d:0 "Honouring our agreement, the Germans officially transferred control of parts of Macedonia to our control. The ceremony was conducted by Generalfeldmarschall Gunther von Kluge and Bulgarian Field Marshal Dimitr Ayryanov in Skojpe, signalling the return of Bulgarian lands in the region to the Treaty of San Stefano."
 bulgariansenhanced.30.a:0 "We wash away the Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine."
 bulgariansenhanced.31.t:0 "The Germans Refuse to Honour the Agreement"
 bulgariansenhanced.31.d:0 "It appears the rumours of German misdeeds, told from Ireland to Cathay, are true. They have refused to give us the territory they agreed on, breaking our pact and revealing themselves as traitors. This cannot stand."
 bulgariansenhanced.31.a:0 "Perhaps we should consider better allies.."
 bulgariansenhanced.32.t:0 "The Bulgarians Propose a Deal"
 bulgariansenhanced.32.d:0 "The Bulgarian Ambassador presented the Italian government today with the proposition of splitting Greece between them. Our Mediterranean ambitions are apparent to the Bulgarians it would seem, who request we return Thrace to them for aid in our campaign to ensure the control of the Adriatic. How should we respond?"
 bulgariansenhanced.32.a:0 "We share similar goals, and how hard can it be to invade Greece?"
 bulgariansenhanced.32.b:0 "Bulgaria? You mean Provincia Thracia"
 bulgariansenhanced.33.t:0 "The Italians Agree To Our Proposal"
 bulgariansenhanced.33.d:0 "The Italians have agreed to return Thrace to us should they come into conflict with the Greeks, returning us to the Aegan sea."
 bulgariansenhanced.33.a:0 "I'm sure the Italians will have no problem with the Greeks."
 bulgariansenhanced.34.t:0 "The Italians Refuse Us"
 bulgariansenhanced.34.d:0 "The Italian government has turned us down, like they betrayed the Germans and Austrians in the Great War. They can be trusted with nothing it would seem, intending to take all of Greeec for themselves."
 bulgariansenhanced.34.a:0 "Then we shall work to undermine them."
 bulgariansenhanced.35.t:0 "Give Thrace to Bulgaria?"
 bulgariansenhanced.35.d:0 "Greece has been conquered, a stunning display by our capable and incredible army, and now the Bulgarians have requested permission to send their troops into Thrace to take it. Should we honour the pact?"
 bulgariansenhanced.35.a:0 "Yes,the Great War injustices must be removed."
 bulgariansenhanced.35.b:0 "I think we'll keep it."
 bulgariansenhanced.36.t:0 "The Italians Return Thrace"
 bulgariansenhanced.36.d:0 "Today, in a grand ceremony in Gyumyurdžina, formely Komotini, Italian forces lowered the Greek flag and Bulgarian soldiers raised our proud colours, bringing us back to the Aegan Sea and returning our stolen lands. The Tsar himself was present for the occasion, along with parts of the Royal Family."
 bulgariansenhanced.36.a:0 "It's good to be back."
 bulgariansenhanced.37.t:0 "The Italians Refuse to Return Thrace"
 bulgariansenhanced.37.d:0 "On the border with Italian occupied Greece, Bulgarian forces were stopped from crossing into Thrace today by Italians. Despite the lack of armed conflict between the two, tensions remain high as the Italians have refused to return Thrace to us. This great betrayal will not be taken lightly."
 bulgariansenhanced.37.a:0 "We will not bow to those who lost to Africans once."

  BUL_exercise_direct_power_desc:0 "Assuming direct control of the government allows us to have perfect control of our country and to oust all who are against us."
  BUL_revise_our_regime_desc:0 "Revising our Regime will give control of the country to the Prime Minister, but will make us favourable with the Western Powers."
  BUL_fight_the_crisis_desc:0 "Bulgaria was hit hard by the crisis. United as a country, we must band together to defeat the crisis, or collapse under it separately."
  BUL_restore_the_bulgarian_army_desc:0 "Since the end of the Great War, our army has been a disgrace to the community. Part of this is to be blamed on the peace treaty, but also on our lack of doing something about it. We should reorganise the army."
  BUL_greater_bulgaria_desc:0 "Ever since the Great War we've had the concept of a Greater Bulgaria. Now we're an independent and strong power, we finally have the ability to pursue that."
  BUL_sign_salonika_agreement_desc:0 "One of the first things we should do is cancel the restrictions placed on us. We can do so by signing a treaty with the Greeks and the other members of the Balkan Entente."
  BUL_ignore_treaty_neuilly_sur_seine_desc:0 "The results of our loss during World War I are still apparent. As opposed to following Western order however, we should attempt to secretly re-arm ourselves."
  BUL_vmz_sopot_desc:0 "VMZ Sopot can provide us with weapons for the infantry, munitions and artillery. VMZ Sopot might be crucial to the restoration of the Bulgarian army."
  BUL_treaty_of_friendship_yugoslavia_desc:0 "We should start restoring relations with Yugoslavia. We are much alike and they could be a valuable ally in what's to come."
  BUL_expand_facilities_desc:0 "In order to further fight the crisis, it'd best that we improve the industry by means of constructing more factories, and as a result, enlist more people."
  BUL_rearm_ourselves_desc:0 "As part of our plan of re-arming, the first thing to do is to enhance our military production. We do this by building more factories and enlisting more people."
  BUL_acquire_t_11_desc:0 "A first step to modernising the Bulgarian army is the acquirement of military vehicles. Not just trucks, we also need tanks. We can acquire the T-11 tank easily."
  BUL_bulgarisation_desc:0 "Bulgarisation is the process that we plan to perform in Greece against the Greek people. Basically, we change their entire culture to fit into our style, or they die."
  BUL_rearm_airforce_desc:0 "Re-arming the Bulgarian airforce should be one of our top priorities. If we are to prepare for an upcoming conflict, then the airforce is crucial to it."
  BUL_fighter_focus_desc:0 "We should focus our efforts on the fighters, as opposed to bombers. We need the fighters to rule the skies."
  BUL_bomber_focus_desc:0 "Instead of a light airforce, we should focus on bombers and destroy the enemy from the air."
  BUL_air_innovations_desc:0 "We should update our tactics in the sky, and correct our mistakes of the Great War."
  BUL_research_treaty_with_italy_desc:0 "Italy is one of the leading innovators when it comes to sky warfare. We should request their help in the updating of our airforce."
  BUL_airfields_for_germany_desc:0 "It might be beneficial for both us and the Germans that we permit the Germans to use our airbases. For if we are in favour with the Germans, they might reward us."
  BUL_bulgarian_arms_desc:0 "Bulgarian gun manufacturing needs to be restarted. It collapsed as a result of our failure during the Great War, and now we can solve it."
  BUL_bulgarian_will_desc:0 "The Slavic peoples are known for their physical and mental strength. If we are to be unbreakable in order to win, then we shall become so."
  BUL_acquire_panzer_iv_desc:0 "We can produce a local variant of the Panzer IV, mounted with a ZiS-3 gun. It is to be one of our first domestically produced tanks."
  BUL_maintain_soviet_diplomats_desc:0 "Maintaining Soviet diplomats will help us in the long run, by doing so we will be able to restore relations with out Slavic brothers once again."
  BUL_reinforce_tsarist_navy_desc:0 "The Bulgarian navy has suffered greatly from the consequences of the Great War. If we are to reconstruct it, we are going to do this on our own."
  BUL_destroyer_effort_desc:0 "The Bulgarian navy can make good use of destroyers, being connected to the Black Sea, in which destroyers are used to their best effect."
  BUL_podvodnik_desc:0 "Based on the Podvodnik 18, a Bulgarian submarine from the Great War, we could build a number more submarines in order to reinforce the Bulgarian navy."
  BUL_dockyards_of_varna_desc:0 "We should put our effort on producing a concentrated dockyard area to produce ships at. The ideal place is Varna, one of our biggest cities."
  BUL_mobile_navy_desc:0 "As Bulgarians we would never be able to focus on producing capital ships and other heavy ships of the likes, so instead we should focus on building a bigger navy instead."
  BUL_bulgarian_research_committee_desc:0 "In order to advance quicker, we are to focus our efforts on research."
  BUL_bulgarian_research_institutes_desc:0 "We should have our institutes and universities focus on progressing, as it is important that we stay up to date on technology if we are to compete with the other nations."
  BUL_bulgarian_infrastructure_desc:0 "The infrastructure has suffered greatly from both the Great Depression and from our losses during the Great War. We are to recover from that if we want to make our country strong once again."
  BUL_license_german_equipment_desc:0 "We need to upgrade our equipment, but until then we can ask other nations for their technology. Our best bet is Germany, by far, as they have the best technology around."
  BUL_license_soviet_equipment_desc:0 "One way to upgrade our army is to deploy Soviet equipment in our army. Soviet equipment is better than that of any of our potential enemies, and they might be willing to agree."
  BUL_allied_research_support_desc:0 "Joining with our allies, we are more likely to achieve things than we otherwise would. It would be a good idea to percieve this."
  BUL_krali_marko_line_desc:0 "The Krali Marko Line is our way of defending our country from foreign aggression. In order to build the line, we are to use the equipment supplied by our allies."

  BUL_acquire_p_38_desc:0 "Part of our modernisation is the acquiring of modern vehicles. We can acquire the Czech Praga P-38 for a relatively low price. We should consider that."
  BUL_bulgarian_ports_desc:0 "In order to be fully prepared for anything that may stand against us, we need to ensure a route of supply can be maintained by our docks, as such, we should expand them."

  BUL_nadezhda_desc:0 "The Nadezhda was a torpedo boat in the Bulgarian Navy, by the Bulgarians considered to be a light cruiser. We should take the design and upgrade it to accomodate a modern fleet."
  BUL_blacktrap_power_navy_desc:0 "Rather than a big fleet of smaller ships, we should instead field a fleet of heavier ships which accomodates a smaller fleet."
  BUL_across_the_seas_desc:0 "Our navy is far from up-to-date, now one way to accomodate a modern fleet, is to have modern transports. This should be one of our primary goals."
  BUL_air_support_desc:0 "In support of our army, we require the production and deployment of close air support fighters. We should upgrade our airforce to support this."
  BUL_heavy_fighter_project_desc:0 "While fighters are decent, we need multi-purpose heavy fighters to win the war in the air."
  BUL_strategic_bomber_focus_desc:0 "Medium bombers are good and well, but we need strategic bombers, to reach both ends of our enemy's country."
  BUL_skywalkers_desc:0 "Paratroopers are vital to good cooperation between the ground force and the airforce, and we need them to fight our enemy. May the Force be with us."
  BUL_political_force_desc:0 "Rebuilding our country is vital to our survival, but opening our political spectrum would help us in doing so."
  BUL_bulgarian_resentment_desc:0 "The Bulgarians long resent their Balkan neighbours over their losses during the Balkan Wars. We should recognise this and use it in our advantage."
  BUL_reassert_western_claims_desc:0 "We've lost plenty of territory in the past thirty years, we should let the world know that we still desire these territories."
  BUL_german_arm_deliveries_desc:0 "We should try to undermine the treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine, the United Kingdom has said it'll allow us in the face of immediate external threats, and who better to ask than Germany?"
  BUL_deal_with_the_macedonian_problem_desc:0 "For too long have the Macedonians undermined our government. We should deal with IMRO as soon as possible - through whatever means."
  BUL_satisfy_the_macedonians_desc:0 "The most effective way to deal with the Macedonians is to appease them. Sacrifices will have to be made, but in the end it'll be worth it."
  BUL_honour_slavic_allegiance_desc:0 "Our true origins lay far away from here. We should show this to the Soviets, the leading Slavic country. Our loyalty should be only to them."
  BUL_join_the_comintern_desc:0 "In accomodation to the Soviets, we shall request to join the Comintern. This will naturally make them happy, and we will be protected, and our bond with our Slavic brothers will only be stronger."
  BUL_peasant_conviction_desc:0 "If our subjects believe in a successful Communist regime, then we will be just fine in our pursuit of true global collectivism."
  BUL_royal_communism_desc:0 "Our regime maintains Tsar Boris, but only as a figurehead. He will not have any real power, and the Communist Council will be assembled to lead the country."
  BUL_the_peoples_republic_desc:0 "Keeping the Tsar would show weakness. We'll show our true strength by establishing the People's Republic."
  BUL_sign_the_tripartite_pact_desc:0 "Germany would rather that we sign the Tripartite Pact and formally align with them. This would definitely help us on the go, but it could prove fatal in the long run."
  BUL_permit_german_troops_desc:0 "In order to appease the Germans, we should permit the Germans access to our territory to station troops in, if need be."
  BUL_join_the_axis_desc:0 "We have appeased Germany enough, signing the Tripartite Pact and allowing them access were the two steps needed to join the Axis, and we shall request to."
  BUL_expel_soviet_diplomats_desc:0 "We should show our loyalty and dedication to aiding the German cause, by expelling the Soviet diplomats from our country. Striking against our own brethren will convince them of our loyalty."
  BUL_dedication_to_the_axis_desc:0 "Our dedication to the Axis proves fruitful, as our country seems to be more supporting of Fascism. Hristo Lukov would be a wise choice when we elect our leader."
  BUL_the_wrong_axis_desc:0 "It appears we have chosen to join the wrong alliance. The Axis Powers aren't strong enough to protect us, and we maintained the Soviet diplomats. Time to make use of them."
  BUL_negotiate_with_the_soviets_desc:0 "It is time we start negotiating with the Soviets about our possible entry into the Comintern. We should secure our own survival before that of the Germans, and the Soviets can help with that."
  BUL_align_with_the_west_desc:0 "In face of the immediate threats in Europe, our only area of safety is in the Allies, under protection of Western Europe."
  BUL_appease_the_allies_desc:0 "The Allies have made it known that they support Nikola Mushanov as the Prime Minister with his Democratic Party. Installing Mushanov's regime will greatly help our cause."

  BUL_balkan_alignment_desc:0 "In order to advance our agenda, we should perform some alignment changes. Either we align with the Balkans, or we align, the Balkans."
  BUL_befriend_greece_desc:0 "Our decades long rivalry with Greece should come to an end. It's all been fun and well, but now is the time to band together."
  BUL_befriend_romania_desc:0 "Our northern neighbour, Romania, doesn't like us a whole lot. It is time to change that, so that the Balkans will stand together and won't be picked off one by one."
  BUL_formalise_the_balkan_entente_desc:0 "Being a part of the Entente system is good, but we should consider reaffirming it, so we can stand up to those who seek to invade us."
  BUL_alliance_with_the_entente_desc:0 "Now that we have appeased Yugoslavia, Romania and Greece, we should consider joining the Balkan Entente. The Balkan Entente will keep us strong."
  BUL_albanian_inheritance_desc:0 "Not only is Albania Slavic, Albania used to be part of the great Bulgarian Empires. It is time we amend the situation and remind them that their independence depends on our mercy."
  BUL_local_armour_acquirements_desc:0 "Rather than relying on external sources for our armoured equipment, we should devise and produce our own. That way we'll always be secure."
  BUL_over_the_balkans_desc:0 "Mountaineer divisions are of good use in the Balkans. Research into them and deploying them will help us immensely in the long run."
  BUL_protect_the_balkans_desc:0 "In order to protect the Balkans, we need to set up an impenetrable line of forts and secure them with our military."

  BUL_steel_exports_desc:0 "While Bulgaria does not have a tremendous amount of steel, it is enough to support the Bulgarian needs, and even export, to a minimal level."
  BUL_global_detection_desc:0 "The next step in modernisation is, is RADAR, large-scale broadcasting will push Bulgaria into the future, starting with the establishment of a large transmitter in Vakarel."
  BUL_institute_for_nuclear_research_desc:0 "If Bulgaria is to advance with time, then it is of the utmost importance that we start our own research on Nuclear power."
  BUL_jet_fighters_desc:0 "While our old fighters accomodate our military as it is. It won't stay that way, and how better than to advance with a jump?"
  BUL_derhavna_samoletna_fabrika_desc:0 "Derhavna Samoletna Fabrika is a Polish factory set-up in Bulgaria to produce several Polish fighters locally for the Bulgarian military."

  BUL_depose_the_king_desc:0 "It is time we finally eliminate the false king. He no longer deserves to lead Bulgaria."
