 ww1_ethiopia.1.d:0 ""The Emperor had already become a shadow of his former self after suffering a massive stroke in 1909, after which it was said that his mind and spirit had died. In the early morning hours of today, he passed away of natural causes. Following his death, the council of regency—which had taken over after his stroke—continued to rule the nation, with Lij Iyasu assuming power as regent."

 #ww1_ethiopia.2.d:0 "Since Iyasu V was never crowned, due to being widely disliked by the nobility for his unstable behavior and viewed with suspicion by the Church for his alleged Muslim sympathies, he was forcefully removed from power today. In his place, Zewditu has been summoned to the capital, and the Church has formally deposed Iyasu in her favor. She now holds the title 'Queen of Kings'."
