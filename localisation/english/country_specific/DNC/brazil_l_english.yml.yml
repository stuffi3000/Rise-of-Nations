  BRA_cafe_con_leite_government:0 "The Café com Leite Government"
  BRA_cafe_con_leite_government_desc:0 "The power-sharing agreement between São Paulo and Minas Gerais, known as the 'Café com Leite' system, has long defined Brazilian politics. While it brings stability, some question how long this alliance can endure."

  BRA_debates_at_cafe_central:0 "Debates at the Café Central"
  BRA_debates_at_cafe_central_desc:0 "As the Café com Leite system stabilizes the political landscape, intellectuals, students, and reform-minded politicians gather in public spaces and cafés to discuss the nation's future. Their voices echo through the halls of influence—some call for reform, others for revolution. The old elite watches closely, unsure whether these debates are the sign of a healthy democracy or the beginning of its undoing."

  BRA_constitutional_reform:0 "Constitutional Reform"
  BRA_constitutional_reform_desc:0 "With political discourse spreading through cafés, universities, and assemblies, pressure mounts on the government to modernize Brazil’s constitutional order. Reformers push for greater representation, civil rights, and limits on central authority. Whether the elite agrees or not, the question of reform can no longer be ignored."

  BRA_strengthen_the_republic:0 "Strengthen the Republic"
  BRA_strengthen_the_republic_desc:0 "With the winds of reform sweeping across Brazil, it is time to turn promises into structure. By reinforcing democratic institutions, codifying civil rights, and ensuring checks and balances, we can build a republic that not only survives – but thrives. The old guard may resist, but the nation demands progress."

  BRA_the_royalist_current:0 "The Royalist Current"
  BRA_the_royalist_current_desc:0 "With republican institutions in crisis and dissent barely contained, calls to revisit Brazil's imperial legacy have grown louder. Intellectuals, aristocrats, and disillusioned officers speak of stability, heritage, and a unifying crown. Though no throne stands yet, the monarchist movement is no longer confined to the margins of history—it marches back into public life."
