The 1898 Coup by the Empress Dowager against the Emperor and liberal leaders of the Hundred Days Reform deposed the Guangxu Emperor and repealed the Hundred Days Reform, a reform set to make the Qing Empire into a constitutional monarchy. During this chaos, parties like the Revive China Society led by Republican Sun Yat Sen and small groups on Anarchists and Communists such as Chen Duxui have gained increasing support and have launched revolts in the path against the Qing government in the hopes of creating a republic.
