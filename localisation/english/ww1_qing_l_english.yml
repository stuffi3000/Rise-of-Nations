  ww1_qing.434.d:0 "While we have completely driven the Tongmenghui off of China, with their leaders fleeing to Japan like the cowardly terrorists they are, it would be naive to believe the troubles are over. Just like when the Han Dynasty put down the Yellow Turban Rebellion, we had to call upon and offer great amounts of autonomy to leaders of local New Armies to defeat the revolution, and our empire has completely fractured. While we remain in power in Beijing, with some influence over these regional lords, we have little control anymore of what happens in the south of our country."

Thought to be exiled in America, Chiang has adopted the name "Zhong Liao", and disguised himself as an ordinary restaurant owner in his hometown. Perhaps he hid this attraction poorly; the restaurant was abbreviated as "KMT".\n\nWhen authorities confronted the location, they were attracted by the delicious smell of fried rice. Instead of detaining Chiang, they instead indulged in a great meal. It had been agreed, in exchange for avoiding political life, that Chiang will be allowed to continue to operate this local business. Afterall, it is a worthy example of mercy for our new state."

He previously served as Viceroy of Liangjiang in 1904–1906 and Viceroy of Liangguang in 1906–1907. He is a pro-foreign official, and is very skilled at governing. He began his career as an army secretary at Li Hongzhang's camp in Anqing, Anhui province during the Taiping Rebellion, who served Li the longest, from 1860 to Li's death in 1901.\n\nThe other candidate is Zhang Zhenfang, a cousin of Yuan Shikai. He was personally recommended by Yuan Shikai to become the governor, but he is not loyal to the dynasty, he is loyal to his corrupt cousin. He is a choice, though.\n\nThe third, and last candidate is Natong. In the first year of Xuantong, he was appointed Minister of Military Aircraft. In 1911, he became an associate minister of the "Royal Cabinet". Choosing him would appease both sides, since he is not pro-Yuan, nor Pro-western.\n\nNow, the fate of Zhili Province will be decided by the Son of Heaven."

Our court wants to punish the rebels, however we first need to destroy them.\n\nSending Duanfang into the south, along with the Hubei New Army, would greatly help the Sichuan Garrison in destroying the rebels, but would come at a cost of leaving Hubei open to revolutionary activity.
