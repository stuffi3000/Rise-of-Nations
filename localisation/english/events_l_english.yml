 germany.4.d:0 "Repeated uprisings in Austria clearly show that the people there long to be united with our Reich. It is now time to take action and allow the will of the people to be made manifest."
 germany.4.a:0 "How can anyone say that Austria is not German?!"
 germany.5.t:0 "Anti-Comintern Pact"
 germany.5.d:1 "Germany proposes that we sign a pact to address the Comintern’s goal of spreading Communism worldwide, through the use of subversion and violence. By signing this pact, we agree to share intelligence on the Communist threat and act in close cooperation against this menace."
 germany.5.a:0 "Join"
 germany.5.b:0 "Refuse"
 germany.6.t:0 "The Tripartite Pact"
 germany.6.d:0 "The signees consider it as the condition precedent of any lasting peace that all nations in the world be given each its own proper place, have decided to stand by and co-operate with one another in their efforts in Greater East Asia and the regions of Europe respectively wherein it is their prime purpose to establish and maintain a new order of things, calculated to promote the mutual prosperity and welfare of the peoples concerned."
 germany.6.a:0 "Join"
 germany.6.b:0 "Refuse"
 germany.11.t:0 "The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact"
 germany.11.d:0 "The German Foreign Ministry have proposed a non-aggression pact between our two nations. This treaty will greatly increase our mutual trade, and an additional secret protocol suggests the division of Eastern Europe into German and Soviet spheres.\n\nWhile the fascists in Berlin may not be trustworthy, this pact will allow us to deal with Finland, the Baltic States and Romania without fear of outside interference. The eastern territories of Poland will also befall us in the event of a Polish collapse."
 germany.11.a:0 "Sign the treaty."
 germany.11.a.tt:0 "§RWhile the pact is in effect, the Closed Economy trade policy will be unavailable.\nThe War With Germany focus will be unavailable for two years.§!\n"
 germany.11.b:0 "No deals with the fascists!"
 germany.12.t:0 "Moscow Signs the Pact"
 germany.12.d:0 "The Soviet Union has wisely agreed to sign our non-aggression pact. This means that we are free to act without risk of Soviet intervention.\n\nUnfortunately, some of our friends now question Germany's commitment towards the ultimate destruction of communism. When matters with Poland and France have been settled, we may need to revisit this treaty, but that is a discussion for another time..."
 germany.12.a:0 "Excellent."
 germany.13.t:0 "Moscow Rejects the Pact"
 germany.13.d:0 "The Soviet Union has refused to sign our non-aggression pact! This complicates matters, since we cannot deal decisively with Poland or France without the risk of the Bolsheviks getting themselves involved."
 germany.13.a:0 "Curse them!"
 germany.14.t:0 "The Partitioning of Poland"
 germany.14.d:0 "Poland is ours, but the eastern parts fall under the Soviet sphere of influence according to the stipulations of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. Should we withdraw our forces and let the Soviets occupy this territory? Failure to do so would render our treaty void."
 germany.14.a:0 "Yes. Treaty stipulations must be obeyed."
 germany.14.b:0 "No! All of Poland belongs to the Vaterland!"
 germany.15.t:0 "Germany Honors the Pact"
 germany.15.d:0 "In accordance with the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, German forces have evacuated eastern Poland and our own troops have moved in to occupy the territory."
 germany.16.t:0 "Germany Betrays the Pact"
 germany.16.d:0 "Germany has refused to partition Poland with us, in a blatant violation of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact! This betrayal has rendered our treaty with them null and void!"
 germany.16.a:0 "We were fools to trust the fascists!"
 germany.20.t:0 "Second Vienna Award"
 germany.20.d:0 "Recognizing that a new order has been established in Europe, we have been asked by Hungary and Romania to arbitrate in a territorial dispute between the two countries. Transylvania was taken from Hungary and incorporated into Romania in one of the many ill-conceived changes forced upon the world at Versailles. Should Northern Transylvania be returned to Hungarian control?"
 germany.20.a:0 "Give Hungary Northern Transylvania."
 germany.20.b:0 "Give Hungary all of Transylvania."
 germany.20.c:0 "Transylvania shall remain in Romania."
 germany.21.t:0 "Romania Rejects Our Verdict"
 germany.21.d:0 "Romania has refused to abide by the decision we reached in the Second Vienna Award! Their delegation has been recalled to Bucharest, and no territory has been surrendered to Hungary."
 germany.21.a:0 "The will of Germany must be obeyed!"
 germany.22.t:0 "Memel - Lithuania Folds"
 germany.22.d:0 "The Lithuanian government has agreed to our demands, and Memel will be incorporated back into East Prussia. Yet another unlawfully stolen province has been returned to the German nation!"
 germany.22.a:0 "Excellent."
 germany.23.t:0 "Memel - Lithuania Refuses Demand"
 germany.23.d:0 "The Lithuanian government has refused our demands! They are hiding behind the Klaipeda Convention, claiming that Germany has no legal right to the Memel territory. We shall have to explain our position to them by different means..."
 germany.23.a:0 "Stubborn fools."
 germany.24.t:0 "German Military Mission to China"
 germany.24.d:0 "Germany has enjoyed good relations with China since the end of the previous Weltkrieg, despite the loss of our Chinese possessions. A German military mission has been present in China for a number of years, and Alexander von Falkenhausen has made great progress in reforming parts of the Kuomintang army.\n\nThis is naturally of some concern to the Japanese, given their present war against China. They are demanding the immediate withdrawal of all German support to the Chinese."
 germany.24.a:0 "Recall von Falkenhausen."
 germany.24.b:0 "No, our advisors will stay."
 germany.24.c:0 "No, our advisors will stay, just as we have promised the Chinese."
 germany.25.t:0 "Military Advisors Recalled"
 germany.25.d:0 "Deteriorating relations with China has made it politically unfeasible to maintain a military mission in their country. Alexander von Falkenhausen and the rest of our advisors have been recalled."
 germany.25.a:0 "We shall put him to work."
 germany.26.t:0 "China Detains Military Advisors"
 germany.26.d:0 "Germany and China are in a state of war, and the Chinese have consequently detained the German military advisors that were reforming their army. Von Falkenhausen and a few of his officers managed to elude capture, and are now on their way back to Europe."
 germany.26.a:0 "Good man!"
 germany.27.t:0 "Fortifying the Westwall"
 germany.27.d:0 "Army pioneers have finished their survey of our existing fortifications, and identified the locations where they should be strengthened. The necessary construction orders have been placed."
 germany.27.a:0 "This will hold better than the Siegfried Line."
 germany.28.t:0 "Germans press for Anschluss"
 germany.28.d:0 "Civil unrest and acts of violence have broken out as protesters voice their desire for Austria to join Germany in a union of German peoples. Berlin is pressing hard for an Anschluss, which would see Austria annexed into their nation."
 germany.28.a:0 "We shall join the German Reich!"
 germany.28.b:0 "No, Austria's destiny lies elsewhere."
 germany.29.t:0 "Austria refuses the Anschluss!"
 germany.29.d:0 "The fools in Vienna have refused to accept the merger of our two nations! This is a blatant disregard for the will of the Austrian people, and it will not stand! We may have to enforce the Anschluss through military means."
 germany.29.a:0 "We must prepare for a military intervention."
 germany.40.t:0 "The Munich Conference"
 germany.40.d:0 "German demands for the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia, where a significant number of ethnic Germans live, have come to a head. [GER.GetLeader] has positioned forces along the Czechoslovakian border in preparation for an attack. Talks are being held in Munich between Britain, France, Italy and Germany in the hopes of negotiating a peaceful end to the Sudeten Crisis. What will the British position be?"
 germany.40.d_2:0 "German demands for the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia, where a significant number of ethnic Germans live, have come to a head. [GER.GetLeader] has positioned forces along the Czechoslovakian border in preparation for an attack. As we have already proven that we won't accept German expansionism, this means we now have another ally in the war against Germany."
 germany.40.d_3:0 "German demands for the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia, where a significant number of ethnic Germans live, have come to a head. [GER.GetLeader] has positioned forces along the Czechoslovakian border in preparation for an attack. Talks are being held in Munich between the Netherlands, Britain, France, Italy and Germany in the hopes of negotiating a peaceful end to the Sudeten Crisis. What will the Dutch position be?"
 germany.40.a:0 "The Czechs are on their own."
 germany.40.b:0 "Czechoslovakia must be defended!"
 germany.41.d:0 "German demands for the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia, where a significant number of ethnic Germans live, have come to a head. [GER.GetLeader] has positioned forces along the Czechoslovakian border in preparation for an attack. Talks are being held in Munich between Britain, France, Italy and Germany in the hopes of negotiating a peaceful end to the Sudeten Crisis.\n\nThe British have made it clear that they have no intention of going to war over a 'quarrel in a far-away country.' Should we follow their lead, or will we honor our obligations to Czechoslovakia by offering them support?"
 germany.41.a:0 "Leave the Czechs to their fate."
 germany.41.b:0 "The British be damned! France supports her friends!"
 germany.42.d:0 "German demands for the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia, where a significant number of ethnic Germans live, have come to a head. [GER.GetLeader] has positioned forces along the Czechoslovakian border in preparation for an attack. Talks are being held in Munich between Britain, France, Italy and Germany in the hopes of negotiating a peaceful end to the Sudeten Crisis.\n\nThe British have refused to back down, and are instead threatening the Germans with war if they violate Czechoslovakia's borders. War may be imminent."
 germany.42.a:0 "We must prepare!"
 germany.42.b:0 "France should stay out of this."
 germany.43.t:0 "France leaves the Allies"
 germany.43.d:0 "The stubborn French have refused to follow our lead in the Sudeten Crisis! They stand by their support of Czechoslovakia, and since we do not they have decided to rescind our mutual alliance. Even now, France is preparing for an imminent war with Germany."
 germany.43.a:1 "Fools! [GER.GetLeader] must be appeased!"
 germany.44.d:0 "German demands for our territory in the Sudetenland region have become increasingly hostile, and now their forces are massing along our border! A conference is being held in Munich where European leaders are discussing the future of Czechoslovakia, but we haven't been invited.\n\nFortunately, it looks like the Allies will stand by their earlier promises of support. They have threatened [GER.GetLeader] with war if our borders are violated in the slightest. Despite this, we must prepare for an imminent German attack."
 germany.44.a:0 "Good! Let them come!"
 germany.45.d:0 "German demands for our territory in the Sudetenland region have become increasingly hostile, and now their forces are massing along our border! A conference is being held in Munich where European leaders are discussing the future of Czechoslovakia, but we haven't been invited.\n\nThe British cowards have refused to back our sovereignty, but at least the French are sticking up for us! They have abandoned their alliance with Britain and formed a new one with us, promising to support Czechoslovakia against German aggression."
 germany.45.a:0 "Vive la France!"
 germany.46.t:0 "The Munich Diktat"
 germany.46.d:0 "German demands for our territory in the Sudetenland region have become increasingly hostile, and now their forces are massing along our border! A conference is being held in Munich where European leaders are discussing the future of Czechoslovakia, but we haven't been invited.\n\nBoth the British and French have rescinded their earlier promises to support us against German aggression. Their diplomats have made it clear that if we choose to resist the Germans, we do so on our own. Perhaps we have no choice but to surrender the Sudetenland..."
 germany.46.a:0 "This is a dark day for Europe."
 germany.46.b:0 "We will never surrender!"
 germany.47.d:0 "Talks have been held in Munich between the leaders of Germany, Britain, France and Italy to discuss the future of Czechoslovakia. The British and their Allies have both rejected our rightful claims to the Sudetenland, and they have threatened us with war if we 'violate' the Czech border!\n\nA plan for the invasion of Czechoslovakia has been drawn up, but this will likely trigger a general European war. We must make certain we are ready for this."
 germany.47.a:0 "Time to do this the hard way."
 germany.48.d:0 "Talks have been held in Munich between the leaders of Germany, Britain, France and Italy to discuss the future of Czechoslovakia. The British have seen reason and accepted our claims to the Sudetenland as legitimate, but the stubborn French are refusing to back down.\n\nThey have abandoned their cooperation with Britain and forged closer ties with the Czechs instead. It looks like we will have to deal with them both at the same time, but at least now the British hopefully won't intervene..."
 germany.48.a:0 "This may work to our advantage."
 germany.49.d:0 "Talks have been held in Munich between the leaders of Germany, Britain, France and Italy to discuss the future of Czechoslovakia. Both the British and French have accepted our claims to the Sudetenland as legitimate, and their previous offers of support to the Czechs have been rescinded.\n\nDespite the hopelessness of their situation, the stubborn Czechs are refusing to surrender their territory! We will have to take it by force. An invasion plan has been prepared that will wipe this vile experiment of Versailles off the face of the Earth!"
 germany.49.a:0 "The Czechs must be destroyed."
 germany.50.d:0 "Talks have been held in Munich between the leaders of Germany, Britain, France and Italy to discuss the future of Czechoslovakia. Both the British and French have accepted our claims to the Sudetenland as legitimate, and their previous offers of support to the Czechs have been rescinded.\n\nRecognizing the hopelessness of their situation, the Czechs have surrendered the Sudeten territories to us. Their oppressed German inhabitants will at long last be brought into the Vaterland!"
 germany.50.a:0 "This is a historic day for Germany."
 germany.51.t:0 "First Vienna Award"
 germany.51.d:0 "Czechoslovakia is a cancer tumor in the heart of Europe, and at last the Germans have decided to take decisive action against them. The Sudetenland has already been surrendered to Germany, and now, as a consequence of the Munich Agreement, the Czechoslovakian territory that rightfully belongs to Hungary is to be returned to us."
 germany.51.a:0 "About time!"
 germany.52.t:0 "The Annexation of Zaolzie"
 germany.52.d:0 "Czechoslovakia is falling apart, and we must act quickly to protect territory with significant Polish populations before it can be seized by Germany. Czech ownership of Zaolzie has always been contested by us, and it is time for the region to join our nation."
 germany.52.a:0 "Zaolzie is ours!"
 germany.53.t:0 "The Fate of Czechoslovakia"
 germany.53.d:0 "Not content with stealing the Sudetenland, the Germans have now decided to seize the rest of our nation. Abandoned by our so-called allies, and with our best defenses lost in the Munich Diktat, the situation appears hopeless..."
 germany.53.a:0 "Give in to the Germans."
 germany.53.b:0 "...yet still we must resist!"
 germany.54.t:0 "The Czechs Resist"
 germany.54.d:0 "The Czechs have somehow mustered the courage to fight our occupation of their country. Their best defenses were in the Sudetenland, which is now under our control, so this should be a swift campaign."
 germany.54.a:0 "Prague will soon be ours."
 germany.55.d:0 "The end of Czechoslovakia is at hand, and our forces are marching into Prague at this very moment. With the surrender of the Czechoslovakian military, we have liberated vast quantities of armaments. Their tanks, in particular, should serve our forces well.\n\nBöhmen will be annexed into Germany as a protectorate, but what should become of Slovakia? We can set them up as an autonomous puppet state under Jozef Tiso."
 germany.55.d_2:0 "Having conquered Czechoslovakia, we must consider the best way to split up these territories.\n\nBöhmen remains German as a protectorate, but what should become of Slovakia? We can set them up as an autonomous puppet state under Jozef Tiso."
 germany.55.a:0 "Set up Slovakia as a puppet state."
 germany.55.b:0 "Partition Czechoslovakia with Hungary."
 germany.55.c:0 "All of Czechoslovakia belongs to the Reich!"
 germany.56.t:0 "The Partition of Czechoslovakia"
 germany.56.d:0 "German forces have entered Prague and the end of Czechoslovakia is imminent. They intend to annex Bohemia into the German Reich, but they are willing to let us have Slovakia. Should we agree to this partitioning? It will mean entering a formal military alliance with Germany."
 germany.56.d_2:0 "After annexing Czechoslovakia, Germany is intending to retain Bohemia as part of the Reich, but they are willing to let us have Slovakia. Should we agree to this partitioning? It will mean entering a formal military alliance with Germany."
 germany.56.a:0 "Of course! Greater Hungary will soon be a reality!"
 germany.56.b:0 "No, we do not need Slovakia or German friendship."
 germany.57.t:0 "Hungary Rejects Our Offer"
 germany.57.d:0 "The Hungarians have outrageously refused our generous offer to annex Slovakia, claiming they have no interest in the region! We will have to deal with them soon enough. For now, we must come up with a solution to the Slovakian Question."
 germany.57.a:0 "Set up Tiso's puppet government."
 germany.57.b:0 "Annex Slovakia into Germany."
 germany.58.t:0 "The Polish Question"
 germany.58.d:0 "The Reichsministerium of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda has done an excellent job, and the people of Germany - indeed, the entire world - has been informed of the injustices our German brethren in Poland are forced to endure. We now have all the justification we need for a war!"
 germany.58.a:0 "Soon Poland will be no more!"
 germany.60.t:0 "The Remilitarization of the Rhineland"
 germany.60.d:0 "Several German divisions recently advanced into the Rhineland, marking the first time since the end of the Great War that Germany has forces positioned west of the Rhine. This is in clear violation of the Versailles Treaty, under which Germany is forbidden from militarizing the region! Unless we issue an ultimatum demanding their withdrawal, the treaty will not be enforced."
 germany.60.a:0 "This is an act of war! Rally the British to our side!"
 germany.60.a.tt:0 "§RIf war breaks out, we will suffer a civil war due to our §YDisjointed Government:§!§!\n"
 germany.60.b:0 "Issue a diplomatic objection."
 germany.61.d:0 "Several German divisions recently advanced into the Rhineland, marking the first time since the end of the Great War that Germany has forces positioned west of the Rhine. This is in clear violation of the Versailles Treaty, under which Germany is forbidden from militarizing the region!\n\nThe French are mobilizing their forces, and seem intent on issuing an ultimatum. If Germany refuses, they are prepared to advance into Germany to deal with this threat. Popular opinion in Britain is against a war, but if we refuse to stand by the French our alliance with them will be dissolved."
 germany.61.a:0 "A war is out of the question."
 germany.61.b:0 "We must stand by France!"
 germany.62.d:0 "Several German divisions recently advanced into the Rhineland, marking the first time since the end of the Great War that Germany has forces positioned west of the Rhine. This is in clear violation of the Versailles Treaty, under which Germany is forbidden from militarizing the region!\n\nThe French seem content to limit their response to this breach to diplomatic objections, and public opinion in Britain is firmly against a war."
 germany.62.a:0 "We will issue an objection as well."
 germany.62.b:0 "Versailles concerns us no longer."
 germany.63.t:0 "Britain Refuses War"
 germany.63.d:0 "The British are refusing to support us against Germany, claiming that the Germans are 'simply walking in their own backyard.' If we go to war with them, it looks like we will be on our own.\n\nPublic opinion in France is against a war, but Germany will only grow stronger and the remilitarization of the Rhineland constitutes a direct threat against our borders. Issuing an ultimatum would be less threatening without Britain on our side. Should we proceed against them alone?"
 germany.63.a:0 "Yes! Germany must be dealt with now."
 germany.63.b:0 "No, without the British we must back down..."
 germany.64.t:0 "Britain Supports Us"
 germany.64.d:0 "Though popular support for a war is lacking in Britain, the British government has recognized the threat posed by the Germans and they have offered us their full support. We will issue a final ultimatum to Germany to withdraw from the demilitarized zone. If they refuse, it is time for our forces to drive deep into Germany and put an end to their tyrannical regime!"
 germany.64.a:0 "Onwards!"
 germany.65.t:0 "France and Britain Mobilize!"
 germany.65.d:0 "The British and French have refused to accept the remilitarization of the Rhineland, calling it an 'unforgivable breach' of the Versailles Treaty. They are mobilizing their forces against us and have issued an ultimatum that our forces back down at once and the Rhineland remains demilitarized, or our nations are at war."
 germany.65.a:0 "We cannot back down! The Reich must be defended!"
 germany.65.b:0 "We are unprepared for this confrontation. We must back down."
 germany.66.t:0 "France Mobilizes!"
 germany.66.d:0 "The British have seen reason and accepted the remilitarization of the Rhineland, but the mad French are refusing to back down! Claiming that this incident constitutes a direct threat against the security of their nation, they are mobilizing their forces and may sweep in across the border at any moment! We are at war!"
 germany.67.t:0 "France Backs Down"
 germany.67.d:0 "The French wisely chose to back down when they realized that their mad enterprise wouldn't enjoy British support. Their forces have been demobilized and war has been averted for now. By golly, that was a close one!"
 germany.67.a:0 "A war now would be madness."
 germany.68.t:0 "France Refuses to Back Down"
 germany.68.d:0 "The French have stubbornly decided to go at it alone against the Germans, and our alliance with them has been rescinded. Yet another European war has broken out due to pointless squabbling. Perhaps it is time for Britain to distance itself from continental affairs again..."
 germany.68.a:0 "Perhaps it was inevitable."
 germany.70.t:0 "The Oster Conspiracy"
 germany.70.d:0 "Believing that Hitler has pushed Germany into a war it cannot win, a group of senior officers within the Wehrmacht have launched a coup! It appears to have been orchestrated by Colonel Hans Oster of the Abwehr, but generals Beck, von Brauchitsch, Halder and Admiral Canaris have also been confirmed as involved!\n\nHeavily-armed men lying in wait in several Berlin apartments have converged on the Reichskanzlei intent on liquidating Hitler and his closest associates. A fierce gun battle is currently raging inside the building."
 germany.70.a:0 "Protect the Führer at all costs!"
 germany.71.t:0 "The Führer is Dead"
 germany.71.d:0 "SS troops and loyal army units rushing to the Reichskanzlei have managed to kill or capture all of the traitor commandos, but not before the dogs managed to kill Hitler! The Führer was found with several dozen gunshot wounds slumped over his desk - working tirelessly for the Vaterland to his last breath, no doubt!\n\nThe surviving conspirators will stand trial for their heinous crime, but for now Germany is at war and a new leader is needed. Who shall be the next Führer?"
 germany.71.a:0 "Herr Himmler will lead us into the future."
 germany.71.b:0 "Herr Göring is the logical choice."
 germany.72.t:0 "The Conspiracy Fails"
 germany.72.d:0 "SS troops and loyal army units rushing to the Reichskanzlei have managed to kill or capture all of the traitor commandos, and Hitler himself led the clean-up effort with his trusty Luger. Miraculously, the Führer emerged from the fighting with only a few scratches.\n\nThe surviving conspirators will pay a steep price for their disloyalty, and Hitler is now even more committed towards prosecuting the current war towards a glorious victory!"
 germany.72.a:0 "Long live the Führer!"
 germany.73.t:0 "The Conspiracy Succeeds"
 germany.73.d:0 "The heavy fighting in the Reichskanzlei has reduced the building to a burning ruin. Despite a large number of SS soldiers rushing to Hitler's aid, army units loyal to the conspirators joined the fray and proved decisive. The Führer has been confirmed as killed, and the conspirators have successfully stormed all government buildings in Berlin.\n\nA large portion of the Wehrmacht has gone over to the other side, but many officers are still NSDAP loyalists. Who should be leading them?"
 germany.73.a:0 "Death to National Socialism!"
 germany.73.b:0 "Himmler will turn this around!"
 germany.73.c:0 "Göring is our only hope at this point!"
 germany.74.t:0 "Preparing the Ground"
 germany.74.d:0 "The Austrians are yearning to become part of the German Reich, but the stubborn government in Vienna has so far resisted all attempts to bring about a union. We must increase support for fascism in Austria. The Austrian Nazi Party will then become a viable alternative to the ruling austrofascists.\n\nAn Abwehr agent has been made available for an espionage mission. Use him to covertly increase popular support for fascism in Austria."
 germany.74.a:0 "Austria will be ours!"
 germany.75.t:0 "German-Soviet Treaty"
 germany.75.d:0 "Despite harsh previous rhetoric against both the people and the ideological leadership of the [Root.GetName], [From.GetLeader] and Germany has now reached out to us, requesting a mutually beneficial research treaty. While exchanging knowledge would help our efforts to develop new tank designs along with promises of other research benefits in the future, there is little doubt considering previous statements that the Germans are doing this for their own sake. Should we go forward with the agreement despite the risk of aiding [From.GetLeader]'s ambitions?"
 germany.75.a:0 "The capitalists are a worse threat to us both."
 germany.75.b:0 "We won't give fascists the weapons to crush the proletariat!"
 germany.76.t:0 "Soviets Accept German-Soviet Treaty"
 germany.76.d:0 "Our negotiations with the [From.GetName] have been successful. An agreement has been reached where our nations will aid each other in the development of new armored units, with a possible extension to other research areas in the future."
 germany.76.a:0 "This treaty will be a stepping stone to the future."
 germany.77.t:0 "Soviets Reject German-Soviet Treaty"
 germany.77.d:0 "The [From.GetName] has rejected our suggestion for a treaty aimed at advancing armored unit research in both countries, presumably fearing our superior weapons would be turned against them."
 germany.77.a:0 "They have hardly diminished the risks of it now."
 germany.78.t:0 "German Joint Air Research"
 germany.78.d:0 "As stipulated by the treaty with Germany, some of their special research projects share discoveries with our engineers. A recent breakthrough in radar technology has come to our attention, opening up unexpected opportunities to advance our research in the field."
 germany.78.a:0 "Detecting the enemy is the first step."
 germany.79.t:0 "Ultimatum from Germany"
 germany.79.d:0 "With Greece under the thumb of Germany, [From.GetLeader] has put pressure on our government to join their ranks. The Soviet-German alliance has put us in a position where neutrality is no longer an option, and now an ultimatum has arrived from Berlin demanding we cede our eastern territories to their Soviet allies and join them in the very pact they are using to force our hand.\n\nAlthough we cannot maintain neutrality, there are other options. Seeking support from Britain is one, standing our ground is another. None, however, can secure the future of the republic with certainty."
 germany.79.a:0 "If we work with the Germans, we may find the opportunity to reclaim other land."
 germany.79.b:0 "We can count on British support, and they can count on us."
 germany.79.c:0 "If these despots want to take our home, they have to fight for it."
 germany.80.t:0 "Danzig for Slovakia"
 germany.80.d:0 "The Germans have long had their eyes on Danzig, seeking to unite their territories in Ostpreussen with the rest of the German nation. Diplomats have warned that the day may come when they make us choose between Danzig or war.\n\nSurprisingly, we have been presented with what the Germans consider a more peaceful solution. They offer the newly created state of Slovakia, currently little more than a puppet state under German rule, to us in exchange for Danzig. \nWhat steps the Germans will take if we decline is unknown, but we have been given an opportunity to resolve this conflict with some territorial gains."
 germany.80.a:0 "This is the best offer we'll get."
 germany.80.b:0 "We will not give what is rightfully ours for what they have stolen!"
 germany.81.t:0 "Danzig Ceded for Slovakia"
 germany.81.d:0 "Poland has agreed to the exchange wherein Danzig will be ceded to [GER.GetNameDef], while Slovakia will now be under Polish control. Through this agreement, we have reclaimed Danzig while maintaining cordial, or at least not openly hostile, relations with our eastern neighbor."
 germany.81.a:0 "Germany is one again."
 germany.82.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses to give up Danzig"
 germany.82.d:1 "Our generous offer of Slovakian territories to [From.GetNameDef] in exchange for Danzig has been rejected, leaving Danzig in Polish hands. Clearly, [From.GetLeader] does not share our understanding of Danzig as rightfully German territory. \n[Root.GetLeader] is furious, and the diplomatic options for reclaiming Danzig appear to have been exhausted."
 germany.82.a:0 "It may be time to consider other options."
 germany.83.t:0 "Anti-Soviet Pact"
 germany.83.d:0 "With the Anti-Comintern Pact, [From.GetNameDef] has secured fertile ground for diplomatic means of containing the Soviet menace. However, the pact does not constitute a military alliance, nor does it contain well-defined obligations for the signatories. [From.GetLeader] now seeks to extend the pact to an Anti-Soviet coalition, a binding agreement to join together in war if any signatory enters into a state of war with the Soviet Union.\n\nWhile substantially more dangerous, and likely to bring an end to any diplomacy we still maintain with the Soviets, this is also our chance to ensure that we have strong allies on our side in the case of war."
 germany.83.a:0 "We will stand by Germany and its allies against the Soviets."
 germany.83.b:0 "Anyone could start another world war with such a pact."
 germany.84.t:0 "Call Pact Members to War"
 germany.84.d:0 "Just as we suspected when we signed the Anti-Soviet Pact, we now find ourselves in a state of war with the Soviet Union. It is time for our co-signatories to honor their promise and join us."

 china.16.t:0 "Defeat in [From.GetName]"
 china.16.d:0 "Our efforts to wage an indirect war against the increased Kuomintang presence has proven disastrous.

As a member of the Little Entente, Romania and Yugoslavia were compelled to offer military support to Czechoslovakia in case of a Hungarian attack but not in case of a German one.\n\nThe Munich Agreement of September 30th, 1938 made Romania once again conclude that it should not count on Western support and convinced it of the necessity of maintaining neutrality between the Great Powers.

Fabricius on June 2nd, 1940, meant a terrible disappointment for the Romanian government circles.\n\nIt clearly showed that Nazi Germany was not interested in maintaining Romania's territorial status-quo and unwilling to take commitments in this regard. Any close friendly cooperation" with Romania was conditioned by its willingness "to act on a definitive settlement of the Balkan sphere". The issue "whether and to what extent the Romanian government is willing to negotiate a border revision request of its neighbors" was now openly approached by the Reich."

This armament suite was clearly not heavy enough for combat use, and the production model was supposed to mount six of these guns.\n\nThe German invasion of Belgium and the Low Countries in 1940 ended the supply of the FN guns, and there was no indigenous machine gun that was suitable for use in aircraft. It wasn't until November 1940 when Romania joined the Axis that the Germans eventually allowed the delivery of the guns to resume.

This attitude generated a division in the Little Entente. Romanian refusal was also due to the fact that the treaty would have given the USSR the right to cross its territory in order to help Czechoslovakia.

While he remains a popular candidate, Landon has continued to criticize his efforts to concentrate power in the hands of the president, and has accordingly avoided similar policies himself.\n\nThreats abroad, both to our own nation and others, remain a reality and neither candidate is in favor of the United States turning a blind eye to them.

General Douglas MacArthur has been a popular nominee among the conservatives, but he is also an indispensable asset in the ongoing conflict and has been reluctant to spend his time campaigning for the presidency.\n\nHe nevertheless remains one of the more promising conservative candidates and can perhaps be convinced to campaign to avoid getting a moderate Republican president.

 political.4.d:0 "The Socialist revolutionary movement, once a fringe popular among radical academics in theory and troublemakers in practice, has seen increased support among the [Root.GetAdjective] working class. The fact that even more people choose to identify themselves with a 'class' at all implies that Socialist ideas are spreading beyond those who actively seek to overthrow the government.\n\n[Root.GetRulingParty] members lament this development, longing for a time when '[Root.GetAdjective]' was what people identified as first and foremost. Their concerns are not unfounded. It could be argued that a revolution is already underway, occurring on several levels of society, and it may be too late to stop it."

Instead of taking up arms against workers who struggle abroad, raise them against the oppressors and overthrow the tyrants!'\n\nThe army, usually a bastion of patriotism and loyalty, has proven not to be immune to the Socialist propaganda spreading rapidly in [Root.GetName]. Soldiers are deserting, refusing to fight for their country, sometimes going as far as joining partisan movements that claim to be preparing for revolution."

 political.6.d:0 "The notion that the Socialist movement represents the people has certainly gotten wind in its sails in [Root.GetName], where the public support for the Socialist party has increased rapidly in the past months. But those who call for revolution are no longer a disparate collection of guerrillas and disgruntled labor unions. The group behind the call for revolt is organized enough to form a government if they succeed.\n\nNevertheless, if the revolution started now, it could hardly be executed without launching [Root.GetName] into civil war. Should the revolutionaries risk tearing the nation in two to satisfy their impatience, or wait for a better opportunity in the future?"

Only by removing them from power can we make this nation grow!'\n\nThe Nationalist speakers in [Root.GetName] have made no secret of what they think of our current rulership and political system.

 political.8.t:0 "Nationalist Sympathies in the Military"
 political.8.d:1 "Several high-ranking members of the [Root.GetAdjective] military have expressed support, some privately and some openly, for the Nationalist movement in [Root.GetName]. They feel the [Root.GetRulingParty] has forgotten how important force of arms is to keeping the country together, and are increasingly annoyed by the army being treated by the government as more of a tool than a one of the nation's most important institutions. Some of them go as far as to suggest that a new government is needed, one that knows how to lead [Root.GetName] into the next half of the century.\n\nThis faction may not predominantly be politicians, but some of them have gained positions in the department of defense. If these developments continue, they may have sufficient political support to execute a coup."

 political.9.t:0 "Nationalist Coup d'état"
 political.9.d:0 "Some will say they saw it coming. Both those who warned against the dangers of Nationalist and those who extolled it as the savior of [Root.GetName] have found their prophecies made reality today, as the military in [Root.Capital.GetName] overthrew the [Root.GetRulingParty]-led government and seized power. [Root.GetLeader] is missing, rumored to have gone into exile, and the coup has been met with little initial resistance.\n\nThe new [Root.GetAdjective] leadership has no plans to allow resistance to grow, either. Martial law has been declared and with the changes that are underway, whatever comes after is unlikely to be very different."

 political.10.d:1 "While the attempts of the Nationalist movement to revive nationalistic sentiment have seen some success, the resistance against these ideas remains high. The generals plotting to overthrow the current administration are disappointed in the lack of confidence the [Root.GetAdjective] population themselves seem to have in [Root.GetNationalistParty].\n\nThey remain certain that the people will eventually tire of [Root.GetLeader], but are divided on what course of action to take. Some call for a coup to be executed now, before [Root.GetName]'s enemies take action. However, doing so while public support is limited would plunge the nation into civil war."

 political.11.t:0 "Nationalist Assault Divisions Form"
 political.11.d:0 "The political and the martial have always been intertwined in Nationalist. In parallel with its growing political movement, Nationalist parties have begun to form paramilitary organizations to protect against both internal and external threats, the internal threats being their political opponents. Although many people find this development worrying, the wave of militaristic furor has led to an increased amount of volunteers joining our armed forces.\n\nThe political leaders of the movement have pointed out that their opponents have reason to be afraid. Having the army permeated on several levels by so explicitly political elements, the enemies of [Root.GetName] and the enemies of Nationalist are beginning to look very much alike."
 political.11.a:0 "Only traitors to the country have anything to fear."

 political.12.d:0 "'[Root.GetLeader] would have you believe [Root.GetName] stands safe and united. It is no surprise such lies have poisoned the minds of our people, when a snake is coiled up next door! Look no further than across our border to see countrymen having turned on each other in the name of Socialist, declaring the end of nations. How long until they declare our nation dead as well? Will the [Root.GetRulingParty] protect us from this threat?'\n\nThe growth of the Nationalist movement in [Root.GetName] has been bolstered by the proximity of the Socialist revolution. Many moderates who might normally dismiss Nationalist as another misguided ideological experiment find this to be a very real concern for them as well. Given the choice between the Socialist of our neighbors and a Nationalist regime, they would admittedly prefer the latter. They might even be willing to actively support it."

 political.13.d:0 "'If we silence the voices of the people, how can any of us claim to be the voice of [Root.GetName] ourselves? If we fear dissent, if we fear being publicly denounced or ousted by public vote, what we truly fear is that we are hated and reviled by our own citizens. Does the [Root.GetRulingParty] really have so little confidence in its principles?'\n\nA careful and loosely organized, but passionate faction in the government has begun to push for less repressive policies against enemies of the state. They want the public involved in decision-making through referendums and local party meetings, even if this means risking the future of the current agenda."

 political.14.d:0 "Surprisingly, the call for more referendums and less repressive measures against opponents of the regime has received some support in internal party discussions. While [Root.GetRulingParty] leadership remains skeptical, several influential members have supported a shift.\n\nPerhaps they have confidence that little will change in practice, or perhaps they are secretly traitors to the party cause, as many of their opponents would have it. Regardless, if the public call for such changes should come, some of the leaders of [Root.GetName] are ready to compromise."

 political.15.d:0 "Relaxing the restrictions on what sort of anti-[Root.GetRulingParty] propaganda can be spread publicly has, predictably, lead to an increase in public expressions of dissent. Organized demonstrations and pamphlets are so far found mostly in academic institutions and some of [Root.GetName]'s more unfortunate areas, but there is little doubt that the movement is spreading.\n\nThe nation's leaders are torn over the issue. [Root.GetLeader], who maintains an iron grip on party leadership, has little desire to diversify public debate. The first steps have already been taken, however, and there may be no turning back."
 political.15.a:0 "The movement appears to grow naturally in the absence of of repression."
 political.16.t:0 "Public Call for Elections"
 political.16.d:0 "The demonstrations of public dissent which were once confined to limited areas are now widespread. While people gather in the streets, the [Root.GetRulingParty] finds itself at a crossroads. If we continue allowing this propaganda to spread, the referendums suggested both from within the party itself as well as the opposition may show that we do not have the support of the public. The unity we have strived for is giving way to a plurality of opinions, united against us."

 political.17.d:0 "As freedom of expression and assembly have grown to become increasingly accepted in [Root.GetName], the faction within the [Root.GetRulingParty] calling for holding elections has gone from secret conspirators to publicly supported reformers. Despite [Root.GetLeader]'s protests, the country has been making a slow but steady move towards democracy for the past months and an election now seems like the natural next step.\n\nHowever, far from all [Root.GetAdjective] citizens are in favor of democratic reforms. There is still debate within the party regarding whether to wait holding the election until we can ensure a stable development."
 political.17.a:0 "Those loyal to the [Root.GetRulingParty] will support the decision now."

 political.18.t:0 "Nationalist Demand Referendum"
 political.18.d:1 "The rapidly growing [Root.GetAdjective] Nationalist movement has never claimed that they need majority support before they seize power, counting on uniting the nation under their leadership once their rule is established. However, it seems their public support has grown rapidly. Many Nationalist are now calling [Root.GetLeader] a hypocrite, claiming to represent the wishes of the people while in reality turning a deaf ear to the masses.\n\nThe call for a referendum has been dismissed as typical attempts at disrupting the system by [Root.GetRulingParty] members so far, but at least it's a political measure. If we do not act now, the Nationalist may choose the violent struggle as a better path to power."

 political.19.t:0 "Socialist Demand Referendum"
 political.19.d:0 "Socialist ideas took root in [Root.GetName] a long time ago, but have gained much more widespread support lately. The movement has spread outside political theory and into political practice, with disgruntled workers and even some high-profile celebrities voicing support. The Socialist call this class consciousness. The [Root.GetRulingParty] call it a fast track to riots and treason.\n\nShowing little faith in [Root.GetLeader] being willing to implement the reforms they demand, the more vocal Socialist have called for an immediate referendum to have the current government removed. While we might be able to reverse the momentum of this mass movement, failure to do so will doubtlessly result in the more popular Socialist method of removal: Revolution."

 political.20.t:0 "Democrats Demand Referendum"
 political.20.d:0 "Unsurprisingly, the idea of the people ruling the nation they inhabit can easily grow very popular among the people. The [Root.GetRulingParty], of course, sees the idea of democracy as represented by these movements - freedom of speech, public elections, free press - merely populist rhetoric meant to weaken [Root.GetLeader]'s government.\n\nHowever, there is no denying those ideas have taken hold among the [Root.GetAdjective] population. In true democratic fashion, they call for a public referendum on replacing the current regime. Although currently easy to ignore, these ideas have a way of growing very persistent. What will happen to us if we make peaceful revolution impossible?"

 political.22.d:0 "After their request for a referendum was denied, the few reformers of the Socialist movement in [Root.GetName] rapidly lost influence to the more radical elements. With the [Root.GetRulingParty]'s refusal to acknowledge the public support for the suggested reforms, the romantic view of the revolution gradually grew more widespread and the leaders of the movement become those who could most easily start a riot. Those riots have now erupted into a full-scale civil war, with the future of the nation at stake."

A rude awakening for its ardent supporters, whose uniforms, militaristic posturing and over-the-top speeches are now more commonly the subject of mockery than sympathies.\n\nOnce considered a threat to the [Root.GetRulingParty] power base, [Root.GetAdjective] Nationalist is now increasingly seen as an absurd, extremist position and an attack on the most fundamental values of our nation, the very nation they claim to hold in such high regard. The word seems more suited as an insult than a political designation."

 political.25.d:0 "Many Socialist had predicted that [Root.GetName] was going to be the next nation to fall to the so-called international revolution, but after a few months of strikes and red flags in the streets, the movement seems to have died down. The working class, the supposed driving force of the revolution, has more pressing concerns than overthrowing [Root.GetLeader] and seem decidedly unimpressed with how well these revolutions have played out elsewhere. Meanwhile, the intellectuals who wrote passionate calls for slitting the throats of the oppressors have turned out to be surprisingly reluctant to instigate anything that might actually upset their comfortable lifestyle.\n\nTalk of the revolution will likely continue, whether over cheap beers or expensive wines, but it will likely be talk and nothing more."

 political.26.d:0 "After a few months of loud opposition against [Root.GetLeader]'s regime, calling for public elections and more liberal laws on freedom of assembly and speech, the movement seems to have fallen apart. People now express more concern about the stability of [Root.GetName] if such reforms were to take place, with those who clamor for democracy being seen more as troublemakers than everything else.\n\nMore mysteriously, many of the leading figures of the movement appear to have gone missing or stopped their work suddenly.

Not since the Thirty Years' War has Berlin seen comparable devastation - considering its growth, this was seen as an impossibility.\n\nThe Führerbunker appears to have survived the blast at least partially due to the bomb detonating away from its planned epicenter, and [From.From.Owner.GetLeader] is rumored to still be alive, if outraged.

It is speculated that the city was chosen as a target because it has been regarded as an intellectual center.\n\nThe beauty and historical significance of the Kyoto led many to assume it would be spared from the bomb, but it appears the terror of raining destruction on such a place has rather been seen as a benefit, increasing the psychological impact of the attack.

The capital of Tokyo, although expected to be the target of firebombing, was never assumed to be a prioritized target of this new weapon. Yet ultimately, perhaps due to the significance of the new capital and Imperial Palace which has now been destroyed, an even more all-consuming fire has fallen on the city.\n\nAlthough [From.From.Owner.GetLeader] is reported to have survived, the event has raised questions about how far Japan's enemies are willing to go. If the war does not end with this, what targets remain? What is left to threaten with?"

Even the Burning of Washington over a century ago pales in comparison to the destruction visited upon the city by this devastating weapon.\n\nAlthough President [From.From.Owner.GetLeader] has been brought to safety, the nation has been shaken to its core. No doubt, the US hoped to be the first and only country to wield such a weapon. Those hopes have now been shattered in the worst possible way."

With the Vatican City also partially destroyed and the whereabouts of the Pope unknown, the event has horrified not only Italians, but Catholics around the world.\n\nRome's rapid growth in the past decade has been nearly completely undone by the attack.

France was in shock as its capital suffered what may be the most devastating attack it ever experienced, despite centuries of wars and revolutions. The Parisians had perhaps expected conquest, but not utter, brutal desolation.\n\nAny victory parades at Champs-Élysées past the remains of the Arc de Triomphe seem unlikely in the city's current state.

However, even the vastness of [From.From.Owner.GetName] may not be enough to escape such a ruthless enemy.

The surrounding area of Öresund has also seen significant fallout and survivors have begun escaping to Fyn and the mainland in fear of further attacks.\n\nKing Christian X's whereabouts are currently unknown, and the nation's morale has been severely damaged by the attack.

Those who try to gain his trust have further fueled this idea to cast themselves in a better light.\n\nThe current situation is one of exceptional irony: the distrust within the current administration has rendered it unsustainable, and a coup is now imminent.

The discrepacy is currently under investigation, but first leads point towards a large number of people who are technically fit for service managing to avoid the draft through various means. 18 year old students are suddenly skilled workers employed in critical war industry, former athletes fail their fitness tests and in some cases, recruits have simply vanished without a trace.\n\nWhen people are caught and interrogated, they point towards the poor conditions in the army, the indifferent officers and not wanting to die for a lost cause. Military leaders demand a harsh crackdown on people avoiding the draft, but many in the government believe that improving the living conditions of enlisted soldiers might be the better approach."
 stability.21.desc.b:0 "The ineffective official response to the widespread avoidance of the draft has only made the problem worse. More and more recruits never show up after receiving their drafting letter. Counter-Intelligence has intercepted a professionally made pamphlet advising people on how to avoid the draft, suggesting things like bribing doctors to certify the recruit to be medically unfit. Exceptions for family fathers have led to war widows with children finding themselves mobbed with marriage proposals while the number of people applying for exceptions for ethical reasons have hit record numbers.\n\nMilitary leaders have suggested eliminating the last few exceptions and make examples out of a few shirkers that have been caught. Others in the government have suggested that we should appeal to the sense of civic duty in our citizens and point out the consequences of a defeat in this war."

However, others in the civil service have recommended a more measured approach, pointing out that a heavy-handed response may well backfire if the soldiers involved are not as loyal as we thought they were."
 stability.22.desc.b:0 "Government efforts to convince the strikers to return to work seem to have had no effect whatsoever.

Even the workings of the government itself have become affected, as many low level clerks, messengers, and drivers have refused to show up to work in increasing numbers. \n\nIn many places, worker councils have taken over the factory buildings. Reports from the secret police indicate that some places seem to have started production of weapons again - for a major uprising against what is being called "The War Regime".\n\nMilitary High Command believes that decisive action by loyal troops could still win the day, while the civilian side of the government argues that this risks a civil war and certain defeat."

Still in their nightgowns, they have found themselves conscripted into the military and escorted to the barracks under armed guard, where they will be formed up into a separate unit, to avoid their subversive influence from spreading to other units. \n\nThe news of this has spread quickly, and it appears that most people who until now believed that they could get away with ignoring their draft notice have changed their mind.

Rather than bringing people back to the colors out of fear of the consequences, it has made those executed into instant martyrs for the peace movement. Their names and life stories have been published and very clearly edited to make them appear in the best possible light. Mass peace demonstrations have started in several major cities, demanding an end to the war. The War Office reports that they have received a number of letters of draftees stating openly that they will not appear for duty - saying that they would not, under any circumstances, be party to another execution except as the person to be executed."

germany.4007.d:0"Amidst the backdrop of Nazi Germany's global ascendancy, a momentous event has unfolded - the creation of "Middle Africa," an ambitious geopolitical vision that seeks to establish a dominant German presence in the heart of the African continent. Under the leadership of Adolf Hitler, Germany has solidified its position as a superpower, and the dream of expanding its influence beyond Europe has taken shape. The plan to establish "Middle Africa" is characterized by grand ambitions, reshaping colonial boundaries and territorial claims to forge a united German colonial empire.The envisioned territory, extending from the Atlantic Ocean to the Indian Ocean, will encompass vast stretches of land currently under the control of various colonial powers. The heart of this ambitious endeavor lies in merging existing colonies, including territories held by Belgium, France, and Portugal, into a cohesive German-dominated region.To oversee the realization of this grand vision, the German High Command has appointed a team of skilled administrators and colonial experts. Their mandate is to ensure a smooth transition of power, unite diverse populations, and implement German policies that serve the interests of the Reich.The creation of "Middle Africa" signifies Germany's determination to forge an enduring legacy on the African continent, a legacy that transcends territorial boundaries and consolidates its grip on vital resources and strategic locations."

However, it is with great disappointment that I find my ambitions stifled within the confines of the Reich.I hereby present an ultimatum to you and the German High Command. I demand the creation of a state within the territory of occupied France under my direct control. This state shall serve as a bastion of Aryan purity and an exemplar of National Socialist ideology, uninhibited by any authority other than my own.Should my demands be ignored or denied, I must regrettably inform you that I shall not hesitate to exercise my authority over the SS and all its divisions. A forceful and determined opposition shall be the consequence, and I must warn you that mutiny within our ranks is a very real and tangible outcome.I implore you to consider the gravity of this situation, for I speak not out of personal ambition but in the interest of realizing the true potential of our glorious Reich.

This secured the victories of the fascist side, but the greatest hit for the revolutionaries was soon to come. \n\nConservative and fascist supporters in Nagoya launched a coup and stormed the building formerly used by Tokuda, where supposedly the government was located. But it was empty. The only thing they found was a book with a note over its cover, which said "The war is lost. Go home now". \n\nThe remnants of the leftist revolt have began surrendering, and even though the casualties of the war were high, there is nothing capable of stopping the rising sun now."
japa.15.a:0 "Tennōheika Banzai!"
japa.16.d:0 "The Taisei Yokusankai has proved to be uncapable of bringing greatness and stability to the Japanese Empire. Those who fought braverly against the communist menace must and will be the new leaders of Japan, but one problem remains, two factions are currently advocating to become the new leaders of the empire. In one hand, there is the Tohokai, which imitating Italian fascism and German nazism pursues to restore the Samurai and Neo-confucian ethics; while in the other there is the Kokumin Domei, which advocates for a corporatist state, as well as the creation of an economic union between Japan and its puppets. Then, who deserves to be the new leader of the empire of the rising sun?"
japa.16.a:0 "Seigo Nakano and the Tohokai."
japa.16.b:0 "Adachi Kenzo and the Kokumin Domei."
japa.17.t:0 "Manchurian Letter"
japa.17.d:0 "Toyohiko Kagawa himself has sent a letter to [Root.GetLeader], stating that Japan has had enough bloodshed for the rest of its history, and that for the lives of all the Manchurians, Koreans and Japanese, he is willing to negotiate a peaceful reunification between our nations. He promises to restore emperor Hirohito to the throne, as well as banning the most radical leftist parties and an amnesty to all the generals who fought in the war in the fascist side, but if we accept, power will remain on him and his ministers, and the more totalitarian and nationalistic parties will be banned as well. How should we respond?"
japa.17.a:0 "Peace at last."
japa.17.b:0 "We can't trust any commies."
japa.18.d:0 "Now that the sun is rising again, the Japanese have demanded our government to pledge allegiance to theirs again. We might refuse, but that would most likely end with a Japanese invasion, though, we can always try to fight them back, after all they had a civil war just some months ago."
japa.18.a:0 "We have no option, do we?"
japa.18.b:0 "We won't be slaves of anyone!"
japa.19.d:0 "Prime minister Fumimaro Konoe has proposed the idea of forming a party to unite militarists, traditionalists and socialists under one banner, called Taisei Yokusankai. Many politicians support the idea, however, some think having a party with no previous identity will fail to unify the people under its leadership. Some propose transfering power to the Tohokai, which imitating Italian fascism and German nazism pursues to restore the Samurai and Neo-confucian ethics, while other support the Kokumin Domei, which advocates for a corporatist state, as well as the creation of an economic union between Japan and its puppets."

chi.1.d:0 "Today a bomb was detoned in a meeting between the members of the Kuomintang. The explosion killed Chiang Kai-Shek instantly and injured Wang Jingwei, who was transported to the nearest hospital in hope he survives. An investigation has already began aiming to find out who did it, though people has already blamed the communists of Yan'an."
chi.1.a:0 "Call Dai Li and Chen Cheng, now!"
chi.2.d:0 "After what happened to Chiang Kai-Shek, some people in the Kuomintang were suggesting something that the generalissimo would have never let happen: Negotiate with the communists of Yan'an. It would stop these pointless attacks between our own people, and if we are lucky we might even manage to, finally, unificate our nation."
chi.2.a:0 "We will make our best efforts."
chi.3.d:0 "Following the terrorist attack in Nanking, Chen Cheng and Dai Li discussed the fate of the Chinese government. After a long meeting between them and other members of the Kuomintang, they decided to appoint Dai Li as the leader of the country. Well known for his anti-communism and fascist sympathies, many think its the only solution for the communist problem in the north."
chi.3.a:0 "The general invites you to lake Tai."
chi.4.d:0 "After the bombing made in Naking by infiltrated members of our army succeded, Chiang was assassinated, provoking the rise of Wang Jingwei, former leader of the left Kuomintang and close friend of Sun Yat Sen. Now he has reached our government with a proposal to end this madness of a civil war and work together for a better future in China. Some leaders of the party like Mao Zedong have already shown their disavowal for this proposition, while others like Zhang Lan have agreed with Wang Ming in order to stop this unending civil war."
chi.4.a:0 "For a better future!"

chi.5.d:0 "[PRC.GetLeader] has accepted the reunification proposal. Finally after years of conflict, the civil war has ended."
chi.5.a:0 "For a better future!"
chi.6.d:0 "[PRC.GetLeader] has refused to our proposal, stating that it's only a trap to purge the communists just like Chiang did in 1927. Reports form Xian state that the communist guerrillas have began attacking our garrisons, and Dai Li has arrived Wuhan with a report stating that a great scism is now happening in Yan'an, as well as a mass army defection in support of our cause."
chi.6.a:0 "It's now or never!"
chi.7.d:0 "Today the Chinese government has offered us protection and the status of autonomous region if we join their administration. While some think that we won't gain anything from this deal, others say that it's the only opportunity we have to prevent an inevitable invasion by them that we wouldn't be able to defeat."
chi.7.a:0 "We have no other choice."
chi.7.b:0 "We should be more optimistic."
chi.8.d:0 "The government of Xinjiang has accepted our terms, we will begin the annexation of the region today."
chi.8.a:0 "Perfect."
chi.9.d:0 "The government of Xinjiang has refused our proposal, it's time to teach them a lesson."
chi.9.a:0 "Let's go."
chi.10.d:0 "We just recieved a message from Nanjing promising us a great future and a fair amount of autonomy if we join them. While it seems like a good offer and would impede an invasion that we may not be able to repel, there is still a possibility that they backdown."

chi.10.b:0 "How cute of them! Let's respond with an outright no!"
chi.11.d:0 "The government of Yunnan asked us to transfer the control of the region of Sichuan to them. It seems like we would not get any benefit from this, we would loose manpower, resources and factories, but what if we let the Yunnanese have Sichuan in exchange of increase our influence over their economy and army? They would get Sichuan but we wouldn't loose total control over it."
chi.11.a:0 "Send the counter offer."
chi.11.b:0 "Let them have it for free."
chi.11.c:0 "Are they crazy?"
chi.12.d:0 "The government of Nanjing has offered us another deal, they will hand us Sichuan if we become their satelite state, giving them control of some of our factories, divisions and resources. How should we respond?"

chi.14.d:0 "Yunnan refused our offer."
chi.14.a:0 "It's their loss."
chi.15.d:0 "The government of Yunnan has approached us with an interesting proposal: They asked to merge our war efforts against the government of Nanjing secretly, in order to have a better opportunity against them in the future, after all, we both have the same objective, but we must remember that it would force us to respond to their orders from time to time."
chi.15.a:0 "All to defeat Nanjing."
chi.15.b:0 "Why would we ally with some rocks over a mountain?"
chi.16.d:0 "Yan'an has agreed to our proposal, now let's prepare to strike against Nanjing!"

chi.18.a:0 "How nice of them!"
chi.19.d:0 "Today the government of Xibei San Ma asked us a favor: Not to interviene in their current conflict with Tibet. The British government dragged us in their last war against Tibet in 1932, which fortunately ended with the Ma Clique backing down. However, now they have resumed their conflicts with the Tibetans, but unlike in the Qinghai-Tibet war, now the fascist nations of Germany and Italy are menacing Europe with another world war, and if there is war in Europe, there is war in India. We shall not create unnecessary fronts."
chi.19.a:0 "Let them have their beloved dessert."
chi.20.d:0 "Today the Ma government has demanded our subjugation, saying that the only way of stopping the Tibetan insurrections is by having total control over our population. If we refuse, we will be met by war, one that we won't be able to easily win, and unlike the Qinghai-Tibet war of 1932, we won't have any British support if we get pushed back. How should we respond?"

chi.22.a:0 "We will have no mercy."
chi.23.d:0 "Today the government of Sinkiang approached us asking for help against their invaders in the war. Helping them might seem easy, but at the moment our army is not well supplied and our population would not stand another stalemate like in our intervention in the region in 1934. Should we answer to their call?"
chi.23.a:0 "Let's do this quickly."
chi.23.b:0 "Maybe we could just send them some guns?"
chi.24.d:0 "Following the liberation of Alma-ata, we run into a gulag full of people of many ethnicies. They were dirty, seemed exhausted and some of them even appeared to be malnourished. Among them, was an Asian man with a long, shabby beard who spoke to our soldiers from the other side of the fences. He said that he was a general of the Ma army and fought in the Soviet invasion of Xinjiang, and asked us to speak to one of our generals or officicers, however, he could just be a madman or be lying in order to be liberated from his prision. What should we do?"
chi.24.a:0 "Let's make a meeting with him."
chi.24.b:0 "He must be crazy. He will be liberated along with the rest when we reach Moscow."
chi.25.d:0 "After one of our generals met with the man, we discovered something incredible: That weak and dirty man was Ma Zhongying, a general from the Ma Clique who disappeared in 1934 in the Soviet invasion of Xinjiang. After confirming his identity, he was taken into a plane by our forces and driven to the capital, were he would be able to recover. The pilot said that Ma Zhongying spent most of the travel cursing the Soviets, Stalin and communism, as well as saying how much he wanted to go to the front again to seek for his vengeance."
chi.25.a:0 "Welcome back, mate."
chi.26.d:0 "Today the Ma government has demanded collaboration with their government. Now that they have went into a campaign of liberating Central Asia, it was only a matter of time until they forced us to choose a side. What should we do?"

chi.28.a:0 "Let's mobilize our forces."
chi.29.d:0 "Today the government of Xinjiang occupied Tunganistan, conquered by us after the Soviet invasion of Xinjiang. At the moment we have other concerns more important than some empty and useless deserts, but it doesn't mean we will forget this insult to our clique."
chi.29.a:0 "We will come after them later."
chi.30.d:0 "The government of Guangxi asked us to transfer the control of the region of Hunan to them.

They would get Hunan but we wouldn't loose total control over it."

After the invasion of our colony, they sent us a message in which they stated that they could not tolerate having subjugated Yue right next to them, but that in order to reach an agreement, they would promise not to do anything to our enterprises and citizens staying there, as well as right to pass through their territories if needed. How should we respond?"
chi.33.a:0 "We shall begin negotiations about this matter."
chi.33.b:0 "Our navy is ready."
chi.34.d:0 "Zhao Hengti as well as Chen Jiongming used to be an advocate of a federalist constitution, but after being deposed from his governance of Hunnan by Tang Shengzhi, who was being supported by Chiang Kai-shek, Zhao would quit the army, and politics. However, today generals of the Guangxi Clique decided to call Zhao Hengti back, action that was seen as treason by Li Zongren and his most loyal general, Bai Chongxi. The two caudillos would then send their troops to arrest Zhao and the generals who supported him, starting again a civil war in southern China."
chi.34.a:0 "We shall never surrender!"
chi.35.d:0 "Today we recieved a message from the Federated Provinces of China, proposing us a deal in which we would join their administration in exchange of becoming an autonomous region after they defeat the government of Nanjing. The promised autonomy seems like a good prize, even more if we think about the plans of reunification of Nanjing and Yan'an. How should we respond?"
chi.35.a:0 "Seems like a fair deal."
chi.35.b:0 "Thanks, but no."
chi.36.d:0 "The Federated Provinces of China have offered us to enter their union, promising the status of autonomous region.

chi.37.a:0 "Weng Wenhao, the geologist!"
chi.37.b:0 "Zhao Hengti, the federalist general!"
chi.38.d:0 "Today the Chinese government approached us with a deal: Creating an autonomous region controlled by China in our treaty port, region which will grant military access to our army and navy. This might be a benefit if we think about the fact that China would be able to help us protect the ports from our enemies, but in the other hand it might just be a trick... How should we respond?"
chi.38.a:0 "Seems like a fair proposition."
chi.38.b:0 "They will not dare to take it."
chi.39.d:0 "After the defeat in the Federalist-Guangxi war, Li Zongren, old warlord of the clique, and Bai Chongxi, his most loyal general, crossed our border along with 12000 exhausted and under-equipped soldiers.

chi.39.a:0 "A free general is a free general."
chi.40.d:0 "Today Ryukichi Tanaka, a Japanese chief of staff and friend of Yan Xishan, met with him in order to convince him to join Japan in an anti-communist alliance. Yan asked to all the Japanese troops to leave Shanxi and a great amount of money in exchange of an alliance, which will be only against the communist governments of China. Now the only thing to do is to wait."
chi.40.a:0 "Maybe we will get something good out of this."
chi.41.d:0 "Ryukichi Tanaka, one of our chief of staff fighting in the Chinese front with Shanxi, came to us with a delegate from Yan Xishan, telling us that after a meeting with the general, he was willing to enact an alliance with us, in exchange of an amount of money and the retreat of our forces from his territory. While it may seem like we would get no benefit from this, not having to care about defending Mengkukuo from the Chinese might free some of our forces, and let us prepare more naval invasions. However, it seems like the general is not very convinced about our intentions, so he might change his mind about joining us, but for the good of his people, it's likely that he would not attack us again in case of enacting a truce with us. How should we respond?."
chi.41.a:0 "It is worth the money."
chi.41.b:0 "A truce would benefit us both."
chi.41.c:0 "We won't negotiate with inferiors."
chi.42.d:0 "To our suprise, the government of Japan accepted our proposal to join their faction, and assured that they would pay the demanded amount of money at the moment we joined them. However, Yan Xishan doesn't seem too convinced, and thinks it is all a trap of the Japanese to take military control of the zone, how should we respond?"
chi.42.a:0 "Better dishonor than death."
chi.42.b:0 "A truce will be enough."
chi.43.d:0 "Today the government of Shanxi asked us for a general to command their forces in order to improve the quality of their army. Some people among our government proposed to send Sadao Araki, the leader of the Kodoha faction, to help them, while others proposed Yoshijiro Umezu, a member of the Toseiha faction. However, we could also just refuse to send any."
chi.43.a:0 "Sadao Araki might help them."

chi.44.d:0 "Due to the ever increasing conflicts between the CPC and Shanxi, today a guerrilla force was sent to Taiyuan with the objective of assassinating Yan Xishan and taking control over the region. Fortunately they did not succed in killing him, but they provoked a full scale uprising all over Shanxi, commanded by Zhou Enlai, which after Yan Xishan escaped to Beijing, took power over the clique. After noticing their defeat was evident, the remaining generals scaped to Beijing as well, where they probably would join the Nanjing forces as soon as possible."
chi.44.a:0 "The revolution has succeded!"
chi.45.d:0 "Due to the ever increasing conflicts between the CPC and Shanxi, today a guerrilla force was sent to Taiyuan with the objective of assassinating Yan Xishan and taking control over the region. Fortunately they did not succed in killing him, but they provoked a full scale uprising all over Shanxi, commanded by Zhou Enlai, which after Yan Xishan escaped to Beijing, took power over the clique. After noticing their defeat was evident, the remaining generals scaped to Beijing as well, to then join our forces in Nanjing."
chi.45.a:0 "We will rescue your homes from the claws of the communists, whatever it takes."
chi.46.d:0 "Just like the first coup organized by the Russian Guihua in 1933 against Jin Shuren, the Guihua cavalry corps have taken control over the country to end the tyranny of Sheng Shicai. After succeding at invading the capital and killing the few chinese guards protecting the palace, they captured Sheng Shicai and excecuted him in the streets of Urumqi. Finally, they appointed Ma Shaowu, a renowed general member of the Kuomintang, as the new leader of the nation."
chi.46.a:0 "Will this provoke a second Russian intervention in Xinjiang?"
chi.47.d:0 "Today the government of Sinkiang has arrested our advisors, following their new anti-communist stance. Invading them might seem easy, but at the moment our army is not well supplied and our population would not stand another stalemate like in our intervention in the region in 1934. How should we respond?"
chi.47.a:0 "Let's do this quickly."
chi.47.b:0 "Just issue a diplomatic protest."
chi.48.d:0 "Today Ma Shaowu approached our government with an interesting proposal: Uniting our administrations as well as our armed forces. While it may seem that there are no downsides to this action, maybe it would be better for us to have them as our vassal, instead of a brother..."
chi.48.a:0 "We'll be stronger together."
chi.48.b:0 "We have other plans for Xinjiang..."
chi.49.d:0 "Today the Ma clique approached our government with an interesting proposal: Uniting our administrations as well as our armed forces. While it may provide us protection against Moscow, it would mean to sacrifice our independence."
chi.49.a:0 "We'll be stronger together."
chi.49.b:0 "We appreciate our liberty."
chi.50.d:0 "Early this week, prince Mehmed Abdülkerim Efendi of the Ottoman house arrived Sinkiang to take power of the nation, after being appointed as the new leader by the Guihua corps. Some people among the government began proposing the idea of uniting our nations, so we become stronger and are able to better defend ourselves from the Russians, strategy that obiously would cost part of our autonomy. This decision remains in the king's hands, should we join the new Ottoman Empire?"
chi.50.a:0 "Let's hope it doesn't collapses again."
chi.50.b:0 "What a stupid idea."
chi.51.d:0 "The government of Afganistan congratulated us for the coronation of Mehmed Abdülkerim Efendi, and to celebrate, they proposed a union between our two nations. People was astonished by this proposition, but the sultan along with the Guihua corps decided that it would benefit us both to enact this union."
chi.51.a:0 "The Ottoman Empire grows stronger!"
chi.52.d:0 "Today the government of Sinkiang, now known as the Ottoman Empire, has excecuted our advisors, following their new anti-communist stance. Our people is strongly demanding our government to punish the Ottomans, and not doing so would surely anger them. Nonetheless, the decision remains in our great leader's hands."
chi.52.a:0 "They will regret ever existing!"
chi.52.b:0 "What would we gain from invading a couple of mountains in a desert?."
chi.53.d:0 "Today a delegation from the Russian government of Sinkiang arrived our country with a message they wanted us to keep in secret. White guerrillas are currently preparing a coup in Eastern Russia, taking control of all the states between Kamchatka and Krasnoyarsk. They invite us to join them in their war against Moscow when the revolt ignites, however they have told us that the revolution is still in preparation, but they will notify us 120 days before the coup begins."
chi.53.a:0 "We will take their offer into consideration."
chi.54.d:0 "The Second Russian Civil War began after exiled White Russians and Japanese attaches ignited a revolt in Eastern Russia. Due to our country being currently almost encircled by the White forces, our government has broken our alliances with Moscow to preserve our independence and impede the loss of Mongolian lives in a battle that does not benefit us. However, some people have seen this as an opportunity to occupy Tannu Tuva, while others think that it would just anger the Soviets, provoking them to invade our country."
chi.54.a:0 "Nobody will notice it's gone."
chi.54.b:0 "Let's not take a side in this conflict."
chi.55.d:0 "Today we recieved the message from the White Russian government in Sinkiang, reminding us that they will begin the revolt in exactly 120 days, and that they'd appreciate our support in their operation. Helping them may end up benefiting us, making the newly stablished Russian government more willing to collaborate us in the future, as well as providing us a reliant oil supply, however, nothing assures our win in this war, and most probably the Russian government of Sinkiang will not give us any territories besides Sakhalin, unless of course, we find a way to demand them to do so..."
chi.55.a:0 "Moscow won't be as lucky as in 1922!"
chi.55.b:0 "It's not worth the losses."
chi.56.d:0 "The Japanese government has accepted to support us in our struggle against the government of Moscow. We won't fall this time!"
chi.56.a:0 "Petrograd shall be ours again!"
chi.57.d:0 "The Japanese government has ignored our message inviting them to support us in our struggle against the government of Moscow. However, this won't stop us from reclaiming our homeland."
chi.57.a:0 "We will have to do this alone."
chi.58.d:0 "Now that the war with the government of Moscow has ended, it is time to demand to Russia our deserved compensation for our support in the Second Russian Civil War, but the question is, what should we ask to the Russians?"
chi.58.a:0 "We deserve to hold Eastern Russia!"
chi.58.b:0 "War reparations will be enough."
chi.59.d:0 "Today we recieved a message from Japan demanding us to transfer them control over the states of the Far East in exchange for the support they provided us in the Second Russian Civil War. We are most probably not strong enough to defeat their army, airforce and navy, and we are not in a position to fight another war in Siberia, but abandoning the people who fought for us in the civil war would surely anger our population, and reduce their support to our government."
chi.59.a:0 "We have no option..."
chi.59.b:0 "Maybe they would accept another alternative."
chi.59.c:0 "We will defend our people until the end!"
chi.60.d:0 "Today we recieved a message from Japan demanding us to pay them war reparations in exchange for the support they provided us in the Second Russian Civil War. Currently our economy is not at its best state, but they are threatening us with a declaration of war if we refuse, and we are most probably not strong enough to defeat their army, airforce and navy, and we are not in a position to fight another war in Siberia."
chi.60.a:0 "Well, could be worse..."
chi.60.b:0 "Are they joking?"
chi.61.d:0 "The Russian government answered our ultimatum with an interesting proposal: The creation of a buffer state in the Far East. This newly created country would be de iure an autonomous region of Russia, but would mostly function as a totally independent state. We and the Russians will have military access to it and will also guarantee its independence in case of an attack of a foreign country, or from one of us..."
chi.61.a:0 "Fair enough."
chi.61.b:0 "This is an insult to our nation! Banzai!"
chi.62.d:0 "Now that the government of Moscow is not a menace anymore, it is time to restore the tsardom in Russia, but after the assassination of Nicholas the II's family in the Russian Civil War, many Romanov began claiming the throne. Now we have choose: Shall we crown Kyril Romanov, the admiral, or Dmitri Romanov, the cavalry leader?"
chi.62.a:0 "Kyril Romanov, the admiral!"
chi.62.b:0  "Dmitri Romanov, the dragoon!"
chi.63.d:0 "Now that we have seized control over Stalingrad, it is time to change its name to one which is more according to our current administration."
chi.63.a:0 "Tsaritsyn, like in the old days."
chi.63.b:0 "Volgograd, for a change."
chi.63.c:0 "Vrangelgrad, in honour to Wrangel, the black baron."
chi.64.d:0 "Now that we have seized control over Leningrad, it is time to change its name to one which is more according to our current administration."
chi.64.a:0 "Saint Petersburg, like Peter the Great wanted."
chi.64.b:0 "Petrograd, we are not Germans."
chi.64.c:0 "Denikingrad, in honour to Denikin, one of the saviours of Russia!"
chi.65.d:0 "Now that we hold control over Russia, we should begin considering were to locate our capital."
chi.65.a:0 "The north, like in the days of the empire."
chi.65.b:0 "The center, due to its immense population."
chi.65.c:0 "The south, protected by forests and rivers."
chi.66.d:0 "Today, one year after being crowned, Tsar Kyril Romanov passed away, leaving his son, Vladimir Romanov, as the new head of state of Russia."
chi.66.a:0 "Long live the Tsar!"
chi.67.d:0 "Today the Russian government has approached us proposing us joining their sphere of influence in exchange of a great amount of economic investiments. Our country's economy is not currently great, and if we refuse we could easily anger them, but is it worth sacrifying our hardly earned independence?"
chi.67.a:0 "We have no option, don't we?"
chi.67.b:0 "Our freedom is more important."

Before they had the ideal of restoring Puyi's control over China, but now, they can only hope to be annexed by either the communists or Nanjing. Therefore, after hours staying in a temple he had an epiphany. \n\nWhy should the Chinese people be led by a foreign people like the Manchurians? They need a Han leadership, they all must follow the Ming. \n\nBut how would he achieve restoring a long time gone dynasty? The answer was simple: the Zhu family. They are the descendants of the Ming dynasty, and it's said that they are raising a kid, who could be easily converted to the Yiguandao to then help them share their beliefs in all of China. \n\nAnd so they did, they crowned Zhu Rongji, who will be turning 16 in 1944, as the new king of China. At first his mother and her family were hesitant about making their child king of China and mistrusted Zhang, but after days trying to convince them of joining the new Fengtian government, they folded.\n\nNow the leader of the Yiguandao only has to get rid of the family, but killing them all but the child would be too obvious, people would begin asking questions and those questions would one day reach Rongji's ears. There's only one way to achieve this:"

man.13.d:0 "A group of alleged thieves entered the royal palace today with most probably the objective of stealing the goods of the family. Somehow they managed to sneak past the royal guards and enter the house by forcing the doors, not causing any noise to alert the guards of the palace. Once inside they proceeded to steal some of the valuables, but it seems to be that they were discovered by some members of the family, because multiple shots were heard inside the building before the criminals left. \n\nWhen the royal guards entered the palace, they saw a red river falling down the stairs, with the corpse of every member of the Zhu family next to the trail. Why would some normal criminal go and kill all the family of the king just to steal some gold? It will be never known. \n\nAlthough this is a tragedy, the Chinese people must not worry, king Zhu Rongji lives! He fortunately was with regent Zhang Tianran in a temple while the carnage happened. Now they both will bring greatness to China!"

man.14.d:0 "Zhang Tianran was meditating in a Yiguandao temple as usual, until he heard the sound of boots approaching behind him. When he stood up he saw members of the Zhu family entering the temple along with militias, who began aiming at him. Their uniforms were varied, some were dressed with western clothes, others looked like simple peasants, and some of them were wearing the uniform of the People's Liberation Army, for some reason he couldn't comprehend. \n\n"What is happening here?" said the regent, staring at them. He was told that he was being arrested due to an unending amount of crime accusations on him. \n\nThe leader of the Yiguandao freezed for a moment, to then command his guards, who seemed totally overwhelmed, to shot at the coup stagers, but they hesitated. While he looked at the shocked faces of his guards, he heard the sound of a pistol being shot, to then feel an enormous pain in his abdomen. \n\nZhang fell down and began quivering as he felt how life was escaping from his body. "Shoot them!" he babbled, but he heard no response from his guards. "I'll now meet you, eternal mother" he finally said with his last breath. The madness had finally come to an end."
