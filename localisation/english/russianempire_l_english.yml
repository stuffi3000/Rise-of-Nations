These actions are nothing to be shocked by thetreacherous [FROM.GetAdjective] Government as our Great Nation has been at a state of war with them. We have been presented with two choices, we can either try to strong-arm the Finnish resistance leader, or we can grant them limited autonomy. Strong-arming them is extremely risky because if it goes wrong, we risk losing our long created reputation of terror in all Finnish territory. Alternatively, It could also backfire on [FROM.GetName]. Granting them limited autonomy has no risks but because of our recent losses in the war, our government will not do well with it."
