One of these main philosophies involved the institution of an educational system that would 'free' the population from the perceived historical fallacies spouted by the ruling Somoza family.

 ottomanism:0 "Ottomanism"
 ottomanism_desc:0 "Ottomanism was a form of nationalism, likely inspired and formed as a reaction to European ideas of nationalism and the growing Western involvement in the Ottoman Empire. Following the Tanzimat reforms begun in 1839, Ottomanism developed from a need to bring the Empire together. The Ottomans feared the growing threat the Europeans posed, especially after events like the 1838 Treaty of Balta Liman, which allowed for British merchants in the Empire to be taxed equally to the locals, and the growing concern of the great powers over the treatment of Christians within the Empire. The Ottomans thought that if they could unite the Empire fully under one state entity, then they would be stronger and the Europeans would have a harder time encroaching on Ottoman territory, as well as on Ottoman people. Previously, the Empire was vastly split into many small communities that mostly governed themselves. The Sultan oversaw these communities, but most areas adhered to their own laws and beliefs. This accounted in part for the success of the Ottoman Empire; the Sultan didn't force any major changes on populations as he conquered them. Because of nationalism, however, the concept of nation-states with shared senses of identities began to rise in Europe, most notably with the Greek War of Independence of 1821-1830, which also started affecting the various other peoples of the Ottoman Empire. From these instances, Ottomanism developed as a social and political response, with the hope of saving the Empire from downfall."

authsocialism:0 "Authoritarian Socialism"
authsocialism_desc:0 "Seeking equality and a socialist state by force, Authoritarian Socialism aims to reduce unequality at all costs, sometimes interviening in the economy of the nation. However, unlike Marxism, Authoritarian Socialism doesn't aim for collectivization or the abolition of the state."

left_nationalism:0 "National Populism"
left_nationalism_desc:0 "National Populism, also known as Left Nationalism, is a form of nationalism based on social justice, popular sovereignty and national self-determination (both political and economic). It aims to achieve nationalization of the economy, as well as the preservation of national values, traditions and patriotism."

cooperativism_ideology:0 "Co-operativism"
cooperativism_ideology_desc:0 "Presented as a workable alternative to capitalism, state socialism, and fascism, Co-operativism is an economic system based around co-operatives, autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly-owned enterprise. Co-operatives usually also follow Christian values, and invest a proportion of trading profits back into their communities in order to reach social goals."

CHL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The situation of Chile has reached a derisory point. The country has not been able to fix the economy after the Great Depression, four coup d'etat took place in 1932 and now with the recent foundation of the Partido Nacional Socialista, it seems that the once one of the most advanced and stable nations of the region is beginning to go through a dark age. \n\nIf democracy in Chile will prevail or if it will be defeated by fascism, communism or despotism, is yet to be seen."
ARG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In 1930, the September Revolution led by José Félix Uriburu overthrew the authoritarian government of of Hipólito Yrigoyen, to replace it with an even more authoritarian regime. Political parties were banned, the constitution was suspended, and if it wasn't for Uriburu's death in 1932, fascism would have governed Argentina. \n\nHowever, his death didn't bring stability back. Election fraud and economic instability are plaguing the country, and with the Condordancia not being able to fix the situation, it's possible for radicalism to take power of the nation, just like it has in Europe."
PAR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Chaco War ended in 1935, leaving tens of thousands of our brave soldiers wounded, only to return home with no reward at all, only debts, lost comrades and limps, making it so many of our brave men died only for a dry pastureland. This has caused an immense discontent among the people and soldiers, as well as a loss of faith on democracy. \n\nThis along with the military influence in the country, as well as the economic problems, makes the world think democracy will not last long in Paraguay."
MON_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After being "liberated" from Roman von Ungern-Sternberg by Soviet forces in 1921, Mongolia became no more than a puppet of the Soviet government. Its army is totally dependent on the Russian one, and the NKVD assassinates any leader that advocates for Mongol autonomy. \n\nNow the Japanese have taken over Mengkukuo and began launching skrimishes in the borders of Mongolia, making the future of the nation seem direr than ever. However, maybe this instability in Asia is the right opportunity to break free from Moscow."
PHI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Philippine independence was ratified in 1898 by Emilio Aguinaldo, but the dream of a free nation was crushed by the American invasion the next year. In 1935, after 34 of American ocupation, the Philippine Commonwealth was formed, being promised autonomy and eventually indepencende by the USA, however, nothing guarantees that they'll fulfill their promises. \n\nNow multiple islamist, communist and nationalist guerrillas menace the stability of the country, and now that the Japanese are debating the idea of striking South-East Asia, the future of the nation seems dire."
AUS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Just like Germany with Versailles Austria was heavily punished by the signing of the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye. The Austrian industry left with Bohemia, while the agriculture left with Hungary, pushing the new nation into an economic collapse. \n\nYears went through and the Christian Social party took power of the nation, things seemed to be going well enough, but all changed with the assassination of dictator Dollfuss in 1934 after a failed Nazi coup. The Germans made it clear, they want an Anschluss, and they won't be willing to negotiate."
BOL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Chaco War ended in 1935, ending with the life of tens of thousands of our brave soldiers, all to be recieved by an economic disaster. This has caused an immense discontent among the civilians and military, as well as a loss of faith on politicians. \n\nThis along with hate towards the powerful oligarchies, as well as the rising popularity of totalitarian ideologies, makes the world think the glimpse of democracy that still exists in Bolivia is close to be erased."

BRA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "A revolution and economic crisis in 1930, a civil war in 1932, and a communist coup attempt in 1935 have brought Brazil into a phase of great instability. Being appointed interim president in 1930 to then be democratically elected in 1934, Getúlio Vargas was improving the situation of the country, but everything went downhill when the increasing support of the communist ANL carried out the coup attempt of 1935, persuading Vargas and the army to declare state of siege in Brazil. \nThis along with the popularity of the totalitarian AIB and the economic situation of the nation paint a grim image for the future of Brazil."

explanation_about_siberia:0 "Even though they claim to do so, the nazis hold almost no power in Siberia. The region is currently controled either by warlords or exiled political figures, though none of them seems to have the intention to reclaim their old homeland. For now, Siberia is governed practically by anarchy."
stasi_propaganda:0 "§RA peaceful nation defends its brothers through war.\n\nA free worker follows the state that freed him.\n\nA strong soldier is always ready to follow orders.\n\nVorwärts Arbeiter!§!"
