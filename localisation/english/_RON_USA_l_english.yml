RON_American_Alt_History.70.d:0 "The Silver Legion of America, commonly known as the Silver Shirts, was an underground American fascist organization founded by William Dudley Pelley and headquartered in Asheville, North Carolina. Pelley was a former journalist, novelist and screenwriter turned spiritualist, who by 1931 had begun to promote anti-semitic views, asserting that Jews were possessed by demons. He formed the Silver Legion with the goal to bring about "spiritual and political renewal", inspired by the success of Hitler's Nazi movement in Germany. A nationalist, fascist group, the paramilitary Silver Legion wore a uniform modeled after that of Hitler's brown shirts (SA), consisting of a silver shirt with a blue tie, along with a campaign hat and blue corduroy trousers with leggings. The uniform shirts bore a scarlet letter L over the heart, which according to Pelley was 'standing for Love, Loyalty, and Liberation.' The blocky slab serif L-emblem was in a typeface similar to the present-day Rockwell Extra Bold. The organizational flag was a plain silver field with such a red L in the canton at the upper left. Legion leader Pelley called for a 'Christian Commonwealth' in America that would combine the principles of nationalism, and theocracy, while excluding Jews and non-whites. He claimed he would save America from Jewish communists just as 'Mussolini and his Black Shirts saved Italy and as Hitler and his Brown Shirts saved Germany.' Pelley ran for president of the United States in the 1936 election on a third-party ticket under the Christian Party banner. Pelley hoped to seize power in a 'silver revolution' and set himself as dictator of the United States. He would be called 'the Chief' just like other fascist world leaders who had similar titles such 'Der Führer' for Adolf Hitler and 'II Duce' for Benito Mussolini."

RON_American_Alt_History.71.d:0 "On March 19, 1936, the German American Bund was established as a follow-up organization for the Friends of New Germany in Buffalo, New York. The Bund elected a German-born American citizen Fritz Julius Kuhn as its leader (Bundesführer). Kuhn was a veteran of the Bavarian infantry during World War I and an Alter Kämpfer of the Nazi Party who, in 1934, was granted American citizenship. Kuhn was initially effective as a leader and was able to unite the organization and expand its membership but came to be seen simply as an incompetent swindler and liar. The administrative structure of the Bund mimicked the regional administrative subdivision of the Nazi Party. The German American Bund divided the United States into three Gaue; Gau Ost (East), Gau West and Gau Midwest. Together the three Gaue comprised 69 Ortsgruppen (local groups); 40 in Gau Ost (17 in New York), 10 in Gau West and 19 in Gau Midwest. Each Gau had its own Gauleiter and staff to direct the Bund operations in the region in accordance with the Führerprinzip. The Bund's national headquarters was located at 178 East 85th Street in the New York City borough of Manhattan. The organization chose its new name in order to emphasize its American credentials after the press accused it of being unpatriotic. The Bund was allowed to consist only of American citizens of German descent. Its main goal was to promote a favorable view of Nazi Germany. "

RON_American_Alt_History.72.d:0 "The Ku Klux Klan, commonly shortened to the KKK or the Klan, is an American white supremacist terrorist and hate group whose primary targets are African Americans, Jews, Latinos, Asian Americans, Catholics, Native Americans as well as immigrants, leftists, homosexuals, Muslims, and atheists. The Klan has existed in three distinct eras. Each has advocated extremist reactionary positions such as white nationalism, anti-immigration and—especially in later iterations—Nordicism, antisemitism, anti-Catholicism, Prohibition, right-wing populism, anti-communism, homophobia, Islamophobia, Anti-Progressivism and anti-atheism. Historically, the first Klan used terrorism—both physical assault and murder—against politically active blacks and their allies in the Southern United States in the late 1860s. All three movements have called for the 'purification' of American society, and are all considered right-wing extremist organizations. In each era, membership was secret and estimates of the total were highly exaggerated by both friends and enemies."

RON_American_Alt_History.77.t:0 "The Military Government"
RON_American_Alt_History.77.d:0 "A military dictatorship is a dictatorship in which the military exerts complete or substantial control over political authority, and the dictator is often a high-ranked military officer. A military junta is a government led by a committee of military leaders. The term junta means 'meeting' or 'committee' and originated in the national and local junta organized by the Spanish resistance to Napoleon's invasion of Spain in 1808. The term is now used to refer to an authoritarian form of government characterized by oligarchic military dictatorship, as distinguished from other categories of authoritarian rule, specifically strongman (autocratic military dictatorships); machine (oligarchic party dictatorships); and bossism (autocratic party dictatorships). A junta often comes to power as a result of a coup d'état. The junta may either formally take power as the nation's governing body, with the power to rule by decree, or may wield power by exercising binding (but informal) control over a nominally civilian government. These two forms of junta rule are sometimes called open rule and disguised rule. Disguised rule may take the form of either civilianization or indirect rule. Civilianization occurs when a junta publicly ends its obviously military features, but continues its dominance. For example, the junta may terminate martial law, forgo military uniforms in favor of civilian attire, 'colonize' government with former military officers, and make use of political parties or mass organizations. 'Indirect rule' involves the junta's exertion of concealed, behind-the-scenes control over a civilian puppet. Indirect rule by the military can include either broad control over the government or control over a narrower set of policy areas, such as military or national security matters. Who will lead the Military Government?"

The history of the CPUSA is closely related to the American labor movement and communist parties worldwide. Initially operating underground due to the Palmer Raids starting in the First Red Scare, the party was influential in American politics in the first half of the 20th century and played a prominent role in the labor movement from the 1920s through the 1940s, becoming known for opposing racism and racial segregation after sponsoring the defense for the Scottsboro Boys in 1931. Its membership increased during the Great Depression, and they played a key role in the Congress of Industrial Organizations."

RON_American_Alt_History.81.d:0 "The Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), members of which are commonly termed 'Wobblies', is an international labor union that was founded in Chicago in 1905. The origin of the nickname 'Wobblies' is uncertain. IWW ideology combines general unionism with industrial unionism, as it is a general union, subdivided between the various industries which employ its members. The philosophy and tactics of the IWW are described as 'revolutionary industrial unionism', with ties to socialist, syndicalist, and anarchist labor movements. In the 1910s and early 1920s, the IWW achieved many of their short-term goals, particularly in the American West, and cut across traditional guild and union lines to organize workers in a variety of trades and industries. At their peak in August 1917, IWW membership was estimated at more than 150,000, with active wings in the United States, Canada, and Australia. The extremely high rate of IWW membership turnover during this era (estimated at 133% per decade) makes it difficult for historians to state membership totals with any certainty, as workers tended to join the IWW in large numbers for relatively short periods (e.g., during labor strikes and periods of generalized economic distress)."

RON_American_Alt_History.82.t:0 "The Socialist Party of America"
RON_American_Alt_History.82.d:0 "The Socialist Party of America (SPA) was a socialist political party in the United States formed in 1901 by a merger between the three-year-old Social Democratic Party of America and disaffected elements of the Socialist Labor Party of America who had split from the main organization in 1899. In the first decades of the 20th century, it drew significant support from many different groups, including trade unionists, progressive social reformers, populist farmers and immigrants. But it refused to form coalitions with other parties, or even to allow its members to vote for other parties. Eugene V. Debs twice won over 900,000 votes in presidential elections (1912 and 1920) while the party also elected two U.S. representatives (Victor L. Berger and Meyer London), dozens of state legislators, more than 100 mayors, and countless lesser officials. The party's staunch opposition to American involvement in World War I, although welcomed by many, also led to prominent defections, official repression, and vigilante persecution. The party was further shattered by a factional war over how to respond to the October Revolution in the Russian Republic in 1917 and the establishment of the Communist International in 1919—many members left the party for the Communist Party USA."

The organization was formed on March 15, 1919, in Paris, France, by a thousand officers and men of the American Expeditionary Forces (A. E.

The Legion played the leading role in the drafting and passing of the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944, commonly known as the "G.I. Bill". In addition to organizing commemorative events, members provide assistance at Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) hospitals and clinics. It is active in issue-oriented U.S. politics. Its primary political activity is lobbying on behalf of interests of veterans and service members, including support for benefits such as pensions and the Veterans Health Administration.

eoanbm.38.title:0 "McKinley's Second Inauguration Speech"
eoanbm.38.desc:0 "On a crisp March morning, [GetDateText], President §RWilliam McKinley§! stands before the Capitol, ready to deliver his second inaugural address. The crowd gathers, eager to hear the words of a leader who has guided the nation through both triumph and challenge. McKinley, with a firm and steady voice, begins his speech:'§W My fellow citizens, when we assembled here on the 4th of March, 1897, there was great anxiety with regard to our currency and credit. None exists now. Then our Treasury receipts were inadequate to meet the current obligations of the Government. Now they are sufficient for all public needs, and we have a surplus instead of a deficit. §!§G We have made progress in the great work of uplifting and advancing the interests of our people and in carrying forward the civilization of the world. §!'As McKinley speaks, he reflects on the accomplishments of his first term: the victory in the Spanish-American War, the expansion of American territories, and the establishment of economic stability through the Gold Standard Act. His vision for the future is clear and ambitious.'§W The American people, entrenched in freedom at home, take their love for it with them wherever they go, and they reject as mistaken and unworthy the doctrine that we lose our own liberties by securing the enduring foundation of law and order. §!§W Our duties in these new territories impose upon us the responsibility of extending to them the blessings of liberty, education, and free institutions. §!'The crowd listens intently, inspired by McKinley's resolve and optimism. His words resonate deeply, promising continued prosperity and a steadfast commitment to American ideals. As he concludes, the sense of hope and determination is palpable:'§W With renewed confidence in our free institutions and an abiding faith in their perpetuity, let us go forward in the discharge of our duties, and let us hold fast to the American spirit. §!'The applause is thunderous. McKinley’s inaugural speech not only reaffirms his dedication to the nation but also sets the tone for the next chapter of America under his leadership."
eoanbm.37.desc:0 "Against the backdrop of a nation in transformation, President §RWilliam McKinley§! emerges victorious in the election, securing another term to lead §C America §! into the new century. The electorate's decision is a testament to their faith in his leadership and vision. During his previous term, McKinley saw §G America §! expand its territories, defeating both the Mexicans and the Spanish in battle, thus solidifying America's presence from coast to coast. His administration championed economic growth, marked by the passage of the §Y Dingley Tariff Act§!, which protected American industries, and the §G Gold Standard Act§!, stabilizing the economy. McKinley's re-election signifies the nation's approval of his policies and their hope for continued prosperity. As he addresses the nation, his message is clear and resolute: 'Our journey is far from over,' he declares. 'Together, we have achieved much, but there is more to be done. With your support, we will continue to build a stronger, more prosperous America.' The victory celebration is not just for McKinley, but for all Americans who believe in the promise of a brighter future. The nation looks forward to the continued stability and growth under McKinley's steadfast leadership. The story of §C America§! continues, and with McKinley's guidance, the next chapter is filled with promise and potential."

USADNC.1.t:0 "Philippines Surrenders!"
USADNC.1.d:0 "The United States has scored another victory! After 3 years of fighting, the government of the Philippines announced its unconditional surrender to the government of the United States. While it seems like victory has been achieved, the region is not yet stable and the local populations are wary of the American liberators. We will need to sort out our policy in relationship to the occupation of the Philippines soon. But before we can do even that, we must defeat another military enemy, the Tagalog Republic. The Tagalog Republic was formed by the Katipunan, a Fillipino revolutionary movement which originally called for revolution against the Spanish colonial overlords, but now they oppose the American occupation. Despite the surrender of the Fillipino government, the fighting is by no means over."
USADNC.1.a:0 "Occupy them for some time."

USADNC.2.t:0 "The Gold Question"
USADNC.2.d:0 "Since the ending of the Civil War there has been some doubt in the minds of many Americans about the necessity and efficacy of the Gold Standard. Once a solid and ushakable institution in the United States financial system, it has now come under harsh criticism from the more progressive political parties, predominantly by the People's party----now absorbed into the Democratic Party----led by William Jennings Bryan.\n\nSince His 1896 cry of "You shall not crucify mandkind upon a cross of gold," politicians from around the country have adopted tge stabce if bimetallism----favoring a devaluation of the dollar with a two metal standard; gold and silver.\n\nThe latter stance is popular among those in the US who remain in debt, who happen to be predominantly farmers. Favoring both a departure from the Gold Standard and a substantial reduction in tariffs, the farmers have been among the loudest voices in the United states pushing for "free silver", among other economic Reforms. On the other side lie the eastern industrialists, the stanch hard-liners in support of remaining on a Gold Standard to further their financial interests.\n\nDespite his loss in 1896, William Jennings Bryan and the Democratic Party remain committed as ever to advancing the cause of free silver in the United States and conversely the Republican establishment remains firmly against such a course of action. With the Gold Standard Act expected to be introduced any day in Congress, debate is set to begin on what will be a historical issue, and perhaps the most defining policy in the United States for the next half-century."
USADNC.2.a:0 "A clash of the titans."

USADNC.3.t:0 "The Gold Standard Act"
USADNC.3.d:0 "The Gold Standard Act is a critical piece of legislation that aims to stabilize the United States economy by establishing gold as the sole standard for redeeming paper money. This act would end the bimetallism debate by definitively backing the U.S. dollar with gold, ensuring a stable and reliable currency system. Supporters argue that it will enhance investor confidence, curb inflation, and solidify America's economic standing globally. Opponents, however, believe it may restrict monetary flexibility and disadvantage those who favor silver as a currency standard. The decision on this act will shape the future of American fiscal policy and economic stability."

 USA_the_pacific_war_desc:0 "The escort carrier (aka ‘baby flattop’) was a small and slow type of aircraft carrier used in World War II. Most often built on a commercial ship hull - Casablanca-class escort carriers were built around the hulls of Liberty ships - they were too slow to keep up with the main fleet. However, they were adequate to escort convoys and provide air support to ground forces during amphibious landings. Escort carriers were cheap and could be built quickly, serving as a stop-gap when fleet carriers were scarce. Of the 151 aircraft carriers built by the U.S. during World War II, 122 were escort carriers, including 50 Casablanca class carriers and 45 Bogue class carriers."

Proponents believe this move will create a more stable and predictable economic environment, reduce inflation, and solidify the nation's international financial credibility. Critics, however, argue that the exclusion of silver will restrict the money supply and disadvantage certain sectors of the economy, particularly farmers and miners.
