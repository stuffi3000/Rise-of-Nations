 PGG_medium_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "As early as 1934/35, General Heinz Guderian envisioned two basic types to act as the most numerous equipment for the future German Panzer Divisions. The first vehicle was to be armed with anti-tank gun and two machine guns and the second one was to be a support vehicle armed with a larger caliber gun. The first one eventually became known as Panzerkampfwagen III, which was to be a standard tank for the three light companies of a tank battalion. The second one became known as Panzerkampfwagen IV."

 PGG_medium_tank_equipment_2_short:0 "Panzer IV"
 PGG_medium_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "Designed as an infantry-support tank, the Panzer IV was not originally intended to engage enemy armor - that function was performed by the lighter Panzer III. However, with the flaws of pre-war doctrine becoming apparent and in the face of Soviet T-34 tanks, the Panzer IV soon assumed the tank-fighting role of its increasingly obsolete cousin. The most widely manufactured and deployed German tank of the Second World War, the Panzer IV was used as the base for many other fighting vehicles."

It was intended as a counter to the Russian T-34, and as a replacement for the Panzer III and Panzer IV. While never replacing the latter, it served alongside it and the heavier Tiger tanks until the end of the war. The Panther's excellent combination of firepower, mobility, and protection served as a benchmark for other nations' late war and post-war tank designs, and it is regarded as one of the best tanks of World War II."

 PGG_medium_tank_destroyer_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Jagdpanzer IV served in the anti-tank sections of Panzer and SS Panzer divisions. They fought in Normandy, the Battle of the Bulge and on the Eastern Front. They were very successful tank destroyers but performed badly when used out of role as substitutes for tanks or assault guns, as most tank destroyers were. In the later stages of the war however, they were increasingly used as tank substitutes, because there was often nothing else available."

It entered service late in the war (1944) and saw service on the Eastern and Western fronts. The Jagdpanther combined the very powerful 8.8 cm PaK 43 cannon of the Tiger II and the characteristically excellent armor and suspension of the Panther chassis, although it suffered from the general poor state of Germany in the later part of the war, which resulted in small production numbers, shortage in spare parts and poor crew training."

It was developed in 1944 as a successor to the earlier Flakpanzer IV. The Panzer IV's turret was removed and replaced with an open-top, hexagonal turret which housed a 3.7 cm FlaK 43. A closed-top design would have been preferable, but this was not possible due to the heavy smoke generated by the gun."

 #PGG_submarine_3b: "Type IXC"
 PGG_submarine_4:0 "Type XXI"
 PGG_submarine_4_desc:0 "Type XXI submarines, also known as 'Elektroboote', were the first submarines designed to operate primarily submerged, rather than as surface ships that could submerge as a means to escape detection or launch an attack. Its key features were its streamlined hull and conning tower and its large number of battery cells. It was among the largest of the German submarine classes, displacing over 1,620 tons. There were 118 ships commissioned between 1943 and 1945."
 PGG_destroyer_1:0 "Type 23"
 PGG_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The Type 23 was a class of torpedo boat built for the Kriegsmarine following World War I. Six vessels were built between 1926 and 1928 and all served during World War II. Despite their torpedo boat designation, the ships were destroyer-sized, displacing over 920 tons and armed with three 105mm L/45 guns."
 PGG_destroyer_2:0 "Zerstörer 1934"
 PGG_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The Zerstörer 1934 class was the first class of German destroyers built since World War I. They were armed with five 5'' guns and eight torpedo tubes. 16 ships were built, out of which 12 were the improved Zerstörer 1934A subclass."
 PGG_destroyer_3:0 "Narvik Class"
 PGG_destroyer_3_desc:0 "Zerstörer 1936A, known to the allies as Narvik Class destroyers, was designed to carry the new 150mm (5.9'') guns. Designed with three single guns aft and a twin gun in the bow, they were originally fitted with a single gun in the bow. Four of the eight ships of the class were later refitted with the twin turrets. A second group of seven destroyers were built to a slightly modified design with twin guns in the bow."
 PGG_destroyer_4:0 "Zerstörer 1944"
 PGG_destroyer_4_desc:0 "Although the first prototype of a diesel powered destroyer (Zerstörer 1942) was not completed, the development of the ship type continued. Several proposals were made which finally lead to the Zerstörer 1944 project. In addition to a heavy main armament, the ships had an increased Flak armament compared to its predecessors, including the new 5,5 cm AA gun."
 PGG_light_cruiser_1:0 "Emden Class"
 PGG_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "Emden was the first large warship built in Germany after World War I. She was laid down in 1921 and commissioned in 1925. The armament consisted of eight 150mm (5.9'') guns in single turrets."
 #PGG_light_cruiser_1b: "Königsberg Class"
 PGG_light_cruiser_2:1 "Leipzig Class"
 PGG_light_cruiser_2_desc:1 "The Leipzig-class light cruisers were built between 1928 and 1935 as improvements over the preceding Königsberg-class cruisers. They displaced over 8,100 tons, had adequate speed and range, and were armed with nine 15cm SK C/25 guns in their main armament."
 PGG_light_cruiser_3:0 "M Class"
 PGG_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The M-class cruisers were designed as scouts for commerce raiding squadrons. Six ships were ordered as part of Plan Z, with two being laid down before work was halted at the outbreak of the war. The main armament would have been eight 150mm guns in four twin turrets."
 PGG_light_cruiser_4:0 "Q Class"
 PGG_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Q-class cruisers were a modified M-class design. They were designed to be larger than the M-class with a heavier anti-aircraft armament and improved fire control."
 PGG_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Blücher Class"
 PGG_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "Blücher was the last armored cruiser built by Germany. Her design was innovative for her time and paved the way for the later Von der Tann-class Battlecruisers. By World War I, she was already obsolete. Blücher was sunk at the Battle at the Doggerbank in 1915."
 PGG_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Hipper Class"
 PGG_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Admiral Hipper Class heavy cruisers were the first heavy cruisers of the Kriegsmarine. Officially displacing 10,000 tons, in reality they displaced over 16000 tons. They were armed with eight 8'' guns in four twin turrets, with a secondary battery of twelve 105mm guns."
 PGG_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Prinz Eugen Class"
 PGG_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "Officially part of the Hipper Class, the Prinz Eugen subclass incorporates many improvements, including a heavier anti air armament. Of the three ships in the subclass, only Prinz Eugen was completed. She participated in the sinking of HMS Hood during Operation Rheinübung. After the war, she was transferred to the United States and served as USS Prinz Eugen in the Able and Baker atomic bomb tests before sinking at the Kwajalein Atoll in 1946."
 PGG_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "P Class Cruiser"
 PGG_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The P Class was a large heavy cruiser design, officially designated as Panzerschiff (Armored Ship) by the Kriegsmarine. Displacing almost 24,000 tons, they would have been 3,000 tons lighter but 55 meters longer than the U.S. New York-class battleships. The armament consisted of six 280mm guns in two triple turrets."
 PGG_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Yorck Class"
 PGG_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The three ships of the Yorck-class battlecruisers were designed in response to the British Renown Class. They would have been armed with eight 380mm guns in four twin turrets. All three ships were laid down in 1916, but none were completed due to the war."
 PGG_battle_cruiser_2:0 "O Class"
 PGG_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "In 1939, the Kriegsmarine decided to replace three of the planned P-class cruisers with battlecruisers. This resulted in the O-class battlecruisers, armed with six 38cm (15'') guns in three twin turrets. The ships were designed with a displacement of 35,400 tons and a top speed of 35 knots. Construction orders were given for the three ships of the class, but none were started."
 PGG_battleship_1:0 "Deutschland Class"
 PGG_battleship_1_desc:0 "Following the Treaty of Versailles, Germany was allowed to retain six pre-dreadnought battleships. Classified as Linienschiffe (Ships of the Line) by the Kriegsmarine, only two ships of the Deutschland Class, not to be confused with the later Deutschland-class Pocket Battleships, remained in active service through the 1930s. At 04:47 on September 1, 1939, Schleswig-Holstein fired the first shots of World War II as she opened fire on the Westerplatte base in Danzig, Poland."
 PGG_battleship_2:0 "Scharnhorst Class"
 PGG_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Scharnhorst-class battleships were the first modern battleships to be built for the Kriegsmarine. They were built as a response to the French Dunkerque-class battlecruisers, themselves a response to the German Deutschland-class Panzerschiffe (Pocket Battleships). The Scharnhorst class is armed with nine 283mm (11") guns in three triple turrets. Plans were made to up gun them with twin 380mm (15") guns, but with the outbreak of the war, this never happened."
 PGG_battleship_3:0 "Bismarck Class"
 PGG_battleship_3_desc:0 "The two-ship Bismarck-class battleships were the largest warships built for the Kriegsmarine. The ships were designed in response to the new French battleships under construction, with a similar armament of eight 38cm (15'') guns as the Richelieu Class, with four twin turrets as opposed to the two quad turrets of the Richelieus. Bismarck is famous for the sinking of the British battlecruiser HMS Hood in the Battle of the Denmark Strait, but was subsequently hunted down and sunk before reaching port."
 PGG_battleship_4:0 "Hindenburg Class"
 PGG_battleship_4_desc:0 "The German Plan Z envisioned a force of ten battleships in order to challenge the naval power of the United Kingdom. The H-class was a series of designs for the six battleships needed to meet the demands of the plan. Two ships of the H39 design were laid down at the outbreak of World War II, but construction was halted as the war begun. Neither of the ships were officially named, but Hindenburg was speculated as a possible name for the lead ship of the class. Had the ships been completed, they would have been augmented Bismarck Class ships, with a main battery of eight 40.6cm (16'') guns."
 PGG_carrier_1:0 "Flugzeugdampfer I"
 PGG_carrier_1_desc:0 "Designed in 1915, the Flugzeugdampfer I (Airplane Steamer I) Project was a conversion of the incomplete passenger liner Ausonia into an aircraft carrier. The construction was abandoned at the end of World War I. Had she been completed, she would have carried a mix of seaplanes and wheeled aircraft in her three hangars and would have displaced 12,500 tons."
 PGG_carrier_2:0 "Seydlitz Class"
 PGG_carrier_2_desc:0 "Seydlitz was laid down as the fourth ship of the Admiral Hipper-class heavy cruisers. Partially completed by the beginning of the war, she was considered for conversion into an aircraft carrier. The project, codenamed Weser 1, was partially underway when work was halted due to increasing air attacks on Bremen and the lack of resources for her construction."
 PGG_carrier_3:0 "Graf Zeppelin Class"
 PGG_carrier_3_desc:0 "Graf Zeppelin was the only class of ships in the Kriegsmarine that had been designed as an aircraft carrier from the keel up. Two ships were ordered, but neither was completed. As designed, the Graf Zeppelin would carry 30 Bf-109T fighters and 12 Ju-87E dive bombers, ship versions of the Bf-109E and the Ju-87D."
 PGG_carrier_4:0 "Europa Class"
 PGG_carrier_4_desc:0 "Several civilian ships were considered for conversions to aircraft carriers by the Kriegsmarine in the 1940s. The largest of these ships was the passenger ship Europa. Being the largest passenger ship in Germany, she had been used as a barracks ship and a troop transport before work began on converting her to a carrier. Had she been completed, she would have displaced 56,000 tons and carried an air group of 42 aircraft."
 PGG_SH_battleship_1:0 "Schlachtschiff H41"
 PGG_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The H41 design of battleships was an improvement over the previous H39 design. The design called for significantly stronger armor, strengthened torpedo bulkheads and protection for the ships rudder and propeller shafts. The main battery was upgraded to eight 42cm guns, larger than that of the proposed Lion Class battleships of the United Kingdom. As designed, these ships would have a displacement of almost 70,000 tons."
 PGG_SH_battleship_2:0 "Schlachtschiff H44"
 PGG_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The H44 Class was the last of the H-series of Battleship designs. With no limit on gun caliber or displacement, the H42 to H44 designs mounted increasingly heavier armament and armor protection, culminating in the 131,000 ton H44 design armed with eight 508mm (20'') guns."

 RKA_medium_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "As early as 1934/35, General Heinz Guderian envisioned two basic types to act as the most numerous equipment for the future German Panzer Divisions. The first vehicle was to be armed with anti-tank gun and two machine guns and the second one was to be a support vehicle armed with a larger caliber gun. The first one eventually became known as Panzerkampfwagen III, which was to be a standard tank for the three light companies of a tank battalion. The second one became known as Panzerkampfwagen IV."

However, with the flaws of pre-war doctrine becoming apparent and in the face of Soviet T-34 tanks, the Panzer IV soon assumed the tank-fighting role of its increasingly obsolete cousin. The most widely manufactured and deployed German tank of the Second World War, the Panzer IV was used as the base for many other fighting vehicles."

It was intended as a counter to the Russian T-34, and as a replacement for the Panzer III and Panzer IV. While never replacing the latter, it served alongside it and the heavier Tiger tanks until the end of the war. The Panther's excellent combination of firepower, mobility, and protection served as a benchmark for other nations' late war and post-war tank designs, and it is regarded as one of the best tanks of World War II."

 RKA_submarine_2:0 "Type IIA"
 RKA_submarine_2_desc:0 "The German Type IIA submarine was a single hull, all welded coastal submarine with internal ballast tanks. It displaced over 250 tons and mounts five 533mm torpedo tubes. Six were built between 1934 and 1935."
 #RKA_submarine_2b: "Type VIIA"
 RKA_submarine_3:0 "Type VIIC"
 RKA_submarine_3_desc:0 "The Type VIIC seagoing submarine was the workhorse of the German U-boat force, with 568 commissioned between 1940 and 1945. The ships displaced 770 tons and were armed with five 533mm torpedo tubes."
 #RKA_submarine_3b: "Type IXC"
 RKA_submarine_4:0 "Type XXI"
 RKA_submarine_4_desc:0 "Type XXI submarines, also known as 'Elektroboote', were the first submarines designed to operate primarily submerged, rather than as surface ships that could submerge as a means to escape detection or launch an attack. Its key features were its streamlined hull and conning tower and its large number of battery cells. It was among the largest of the German submarine classes, displacing over 1,620 tons. There were 118 ships commissioned between 1943 and 1945."
 RKA_destroyer_1:0 "Type 23"
 RKA_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The Type 23 was a class of torpedo boat built for the Kriegsmarine following World War I. Six vessels were built between 1926 and 1928 and all served during World War II. Despite their torpedo boat designation, the ships were destroyer-sized, displacing over 920 tons and armed with three 105mm L/45 guns."
 RKA_destroyer_2:0 "Zerstörer 1934"
 RKA_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The Zerstörer 1934 class was the first class of German destroyers built since World War I. They were armed with five 5'' guns and eight torpedo tubes. 16 ships were built, out of which 12 were the improved Zerstörer 1934A subclass."
 RKA_destroyer_3:0 "Narvik Class"
 RKA_destroyer_3_desc:0 "Zerstörer 1936A, known to the allies as Narvik Class destroyers, was designed to carry the new 150mm (5.9'') guns. Designed with three single guns aft and a twin gun in the bow, they were originally fitted with a single gun in the bow. Four of the eight ships of the class were later refitted with the twin turrets. A second group of seven destroyers were built to a slightly modified design with twin guns in the bow."
 RKA_destroyer_4:0 "Zerstörer 1944"
 RKA_destroyer_4_desc:0 "Although the first prototype of a diesel powered destroyer (Zerstörer 1942) was not completed, the development of the ship type continued. Several proposals were made which finally lead to the Zerstörer 1944 project. In addition to a heavy main armament, the ships had an increased Flak armament compared to its predecessors, including the new 5,5 cm AA gun."
 RKA_light_cruiser_1:0 "Emden Class"
 RKA_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "Emden was the first large warship built in Germany after World War I. She was laid down in 1921 and commissioned in 1925. The armament consisted of eight 150mm (5.9'') guns in single turrets."
 #RKA_light_cruiser_1b: "Königsberg Class"
 RKA_light_cruiser_2:1 "Leipzig Class"
 RKA_light_cruiser_2_desc:1 "The Leipzig-class light cruisers were built between 1928 and 1935 as improvements over the preceding Königsberg-class cruisers. They displaced over 8,100 tons, had adequate speed and range, and were armed with nine 15cm SK C/25 guns in their main armament."
 RKA_light_cruiser_3:0 "M Class"
 RKA_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The M-class cruisers were designed as scouts for commerce raiding squadrons. Six ships were ordered as part of Plan Z, with two being laid down before work was halted at the outbreak of the war. The main armament would have been eight 150mm guns in four twin turrets."
 RKA_light_cruiser_4:0 "Q Class"
 RKA_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Q-class cruisers were a modified M-class design. They were designed to be larger than the M-class with a heavier anti-aircraft armament and improved fire control."
 RKA_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Blücher Class"
 RKA_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "Blücher was the last armored cruiser built by Germany. Her design was innovative for her time and paved the way for the later Von der Tann-class Battlecruisers. By World War I, she was already obsolete. Blücher was sunk at the Battle at the Doggerbank in 1915."
 RKA_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Hipper Class"
 RKA_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Admiral Hipper Class heavy cruisers were the first heavy cruisers of the Kriegsmarine. Officially displacing 10,000 tons, in reality they displaced over 16000 tons. They were armed with eight 8'' guns in four twin turrets, with a secondary battery of twelve 105mm guns."
 RKA_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Prinz Eugen Class"
 RKA_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "Officially part of the Hipper Class, the Prinz Eugen subclass incorporates many improvements, including a heavier anti air armament. Of the three ships in the subclass, only Prinz Eugen was completed. She participated in the sinking of HMS Hood during Operation Rheinübung. After the war, she was transferred to the United States and served as USS Prinz Eugen in the Able and Baker atomic bomb tests before sinking at the Kwajalein Atoll in 1946."
 RKA_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "P Class Cruiser"
 RKA_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The P Class was a large heavy cruiser design, officially designated as Panzerschiff (Armored Ship) by the Kriegsmarine. Displacing almost 24,000 tons, they would have been 3,000 tons lighter but 55 meters longer than the U.S. New York-class battleships. The armament consisted of six 280mm guns in two triple turrets."
 RKA_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Yorck Class"
 RKA_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The three ships of the Yorck-class battlecruisers were designed in response to the British Renown Class. They would have been armed with eight 380mm guns in four twin turrets. All three ships were laid down in 1916, but none were completed due to the war."
 RKA_battle_cruiser_2:0 "O Class"
 RKA_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "In 1939, the Kriegsmarine decided to replace three of the planned P-class cruisers with battlecruisers. This resulted in the O-class battlecruisers, armed with six 38cm (15'') guns in three twin turrets. The ships were designed with a displacement of 35,400 tons and a top speed of 35 knots. Construction orders were given for the three ships of the class, but none were started."
 RKA_battleship_1:0 "Deutschland Class"
 RKA_battleship_1_desc:0 "Following the Treaty of Versailles, Germany was allowed to retain six pre-dreadnought battleships. Classified as Linienschiffe (Ships of the Line) by the Kriegsmarine, only two ships of the Deutschland Class, not to be confused with the later Deutschland-class Pocket Battleships, remained in active service through the 1930s. At 04:47 on September 1, 1939, Schleswig-Holstein fired the first shots of World War II as she opened fire on the Westerplatte base in Danzig, Poland."
 RKA_battleship_2:0 "Scharnhorst Class"
 RKA_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Scharnhorst-class battleships were the first modern battleships to be built for the Kriegsmarine. They were built as a response to the French Dunkerque-class battlecruisers, themselves a response to the German Deutschland-class Panzerschiffe (Pocket Battleships). The Scharnhorst class is armed with nine 283mm (11") guns in three triple turrets. Plans were made to up gun them with twin 380mm (15") guns, but with the outbreak of the war, this never happened."
 RKA_battleship_3:0 "Bismarck Class"
 RKA_battleship_3_desc:0 "The two-ship Bismarck-class battleships were the largest warships built for the Kriegsmarine. The ships were designed in response to the new French battleships under construction, with a similar armament of eight 38cm (15'') guns as the Richelieu Class, with four twin turrets as opposed to the two quad turrets of the Richelieus. Bismarck is famous for the sinking of the British battlecruiser HMS Hood in the Battle of the Denmark Strait, but was subsequently hunted down and sunk before reaching port."
 RKA_battleship_4:0 "Hindenburg Class"
 RKA_battleship_4_desc:0 "The German Plan Z envisioned a force of ten battleships in order to challenge the naval power of the United Kingdom. The H-class was a series of designs for the six battleships needed to meet the demands of the plan. Two ships of the H39 design were laid down at the outbreak of World War II, but construction was halted as the war begun. Neither of the ships were officially named, but Hindenburg was speculated as a possible name for the lead ship of the class. Had the ships been completed, they would have been augmented Bismarck Class ships, with a main battery of eight 40.6cm (16'') guns."
 RKA_carrier_1:0 "Flugzeugdampfer I"
 RKA_carrier_1_desc:0 "Designed in 1915, the Flugzeugdampfer I (Airplane Steamer I) Project was a conversion of the incomplete passenger liner Ausonia into an aircraft carrier. The construction was abandoned at the end of World War I. Had she been completed, she would have carried a mix of seaplanes and wheeled aircraft in her three hangars and would have displaced 12,500 tons."
 RKA_carrier_2:0 "Seydlitz Class"
 RKA_carrier_2_desc:0 "Seydlitz was laid down as the fourth ship of the Admiral Hipper-class heavy cruisers. Partially completed by the beginning of the war, she was considered for conversion into an aircraft carrier. The project, codenamed Weser 1, was partially underway when work was halted due to increasing air attacks on Bremen and the lack of resources for her construction."
 RKA_carrier_3:0 "Graf Zeppelin Class"
 RKA_carrier_3_desc:0 "Graf Zeppelin was the only class of ships in the Kriegsmarine that had been designed as an aircraft carrier from the keel up. Two ships were ordered, but neither was completed. As designed, the Graf Zeppelin would carry 30 Bf-109T fighters and 12 Ju-87E dive bombers, ship versions of the Bf-109E and the Ju-87D."
 RKA_carrier_4:0 "Europa Class"
 RKA_carrier_4_desc:0 "Several civilian ships were considered for conversions to aircraft carriers by the Kriegsmarine in the 1940s. The largest of these ships was the passenger ship Europa. Being the largest passenger ship in Germany, she had been used as a barracks ship and a troop transport before work began on converting her to a carrier. Had she been completed, she would have displaced 56,000 tons and carried an air group of 42 aircraft."
 RKA_SH_battleship_1:0 "Schlachtschiff H41"
 RKA_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The H41 design of battleships was an improvement over the previous H39 design. The design called for significantly stronger armor, strengthened torpedo bulkheads and protection for the ships rudder and propeller shafts. The main battery was upgraded to eight 42cm guns, larger than that of the proposed Lion Class battleships of the United Kingdom. As designed, these ships would have a displacement of almost 70,000 tons."
 RKA_SH_battleship_2:0 "Schlachtschiff H44"
 RKA_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The H44 Class was the last of the H-series of Battleship designs. With no limit on gun caliber or displacement, the H42 to H44 designs mounted increasingly heavier armament and armor protection, culminating in the 131,000 ton H44 design armed with eight 508mm (20'') guns."

 RKB_medium_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "As early as 1934/35, General Heinz Guderian envisioned two basic types to act as the most numerous equipment for the future German Panzer Divisions. The first vehicle was to be armed with anti-tank gun and two machine guns and the second one was to be a support vehicle armed with a larger caliber gun. The first one eventually became known as Panzerkampfwagen III, which was to be a standard tank for the three light companies of a tank battalion. The second one became known as Panzerkampfwagen IV."

 RKB_medium_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "Designed as an infantry-support tank, the Panzer IV was not originally intended to engage enemy armor - that function was performed by the lighter Panzer III. However, with the flaws of pre-war doctrine becoming apparent and in the face of Soviet T-34 tanks, the Panzer IV soon assumed the tank-fighting role of its increasingly obsolete cousin. The most widely manufactured and deployed German tank of the Second World War, the Panzer IV was used as the base for many other fighting vehicles."

It was intended as a counter to the Russian T-34, and as a replacement for the Panzer III and Panzer IV. While never replacing the latter, it served alongside it and the heavier Tiger tanks until the end of the war. The Panther's excellent combination of firepower, mobility, and protection served as a benchmark for other nations' late war and post-war tank designs, and it is regarded as one of the best tanks of World War II."

After the war, she was transferred to the United States and served as USS Prinz Eugen in the Able and Baker atomic bomb tests before sinking at the Kwajalein Atoll in 1946."
 RKB_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "P Class Cruiser"
 RKB_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The P Class was a large heavy cruiser design, officially designated as Panzerschiff (Armored Ship) by the Kriegsmarine. Displacing almost 24,000 tons, they would have been 3,000 tons lighter but 55 meters longer than the U.S. New York-class battleships. The armament consisted of six 280mm guns in two triple turrets."
 RKB_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Yorck Class"
 RKB_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The three ships of the Yorck-class battlecruisers were designed in response to the British Renown Class. They would have been armed with eight 380mm guns in four twin turrets. All three ships were laid down in 1916, but none were completed due to the war."
 RKB_battle_cruiser_2:0 "O Class"
 RKB_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "In 1939, the Kriegsmarine decided to replace three of the planned P-class cruisers with battlecruisers. This resulted in the O-class battlecruisers, armed with six 38cm (15'') guns in three twin turrets. The ships were designed with a displacement of 35,400 tons and a top speed of 35 knots. Construction orders were given for the three ships of the class, but none were started."
 RKB_battleship_1:0 "Deutschland Class"
 RKB_battleship_1_desc:0 "Following the Treaty of Versailles, Germany was allowed to retain six pre-dreadnought battleships. Classified as Linienschiffe (Ships of the Line) by the Kriegsmarine, only two ships of the Deutschland Class, not to be confused with the later Deutschland-class Pocket Battleships, remained in active service through the 1930s. At 04:47 on September 1, 1939, Schleswig-Holstein fired the first shots of World War II as she opened fire on the Westerplatte base in Danzig, Poland."
 RKB_battleship_2:0 "Scharnhorst Class"
 RKB_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Scharnhorst-class battleships were the first modern battleships to be built for the Kriegsmarine. They were built as a response to the French Dunkerque-class battlecruisers, themselves a response to the German Deutschland-class Panzerschiffe (Pocket Battleships). The Scharnhorst class is armed with nine 283mm (11") guns in three triple turrets. Plans were made to up gun them with twin 380mm (15") guns, but with the outbreak of the war, this never happened."
 RKB_battleship_3:0 "Bismarck Class"
 RKB_battleship_3_desc:0 "The two-ship Bismarck-class battleships were the largest warships built for the Kriegsmarine. The ships were designed in response to the new French battleships under construction, with a similar armament of eight 38cm (15'') guns as the Richelieu Class, with four twin turrets as opposed to the two quad turrets of the Richelieus. Bismarck is famous for the sinking of the British battlecruiser HMS Hood in the Battle of the Denmark Strait, but was subsequently hunted down and sunk before reaching port."
 RKB_battleship_4:0 "Hindenburg Class"
 RKB_battleship_4_desc:0 "The German Plan Z envisioned a force of ten battleships in order to challenge the naval power of the United Kingdom. The H-class was a series of designs for the six battleships needed to meet the demands of the plan. Two ships of the H39 design were laid down at the outbreak of World War II, but construction was halted as the war begun. Neither of the ships were officially named, but Hindenburg was speculated as a possible name for the lead ship of the class. Had the ships been completed, they would have been augmented Bismarck Class ships, with a main battery of eight 40.6cm (16'') guns."
 RKB_carrier_1:0 "Flugzeugdampfer I"
 RKB_carrier_1_desc:0 "Designed in 1915, the Flugzeugdampfer I (Airplane Steamer I) Project was a conversion of the incomplete passenger liner Ausonia into an aircraft carrier. The construction was abandoned at the end of World War I. Had she been completed, she would have carried a mix of seaplanes and wheeled aircraft in her three hangars and would have displaced 12,500 tons."
 RKB_carrier_2:0 "Seydlitz Class"
 RKB_carrier_2_desc:0 "Seydlitz was laid down as the fourth ship of the Admiral Hipper-class heavy cruisers. Partially completed by the beginning of the war, she was considered for conversion into an aircraft carrier. The project, codenamed Weser 1, was partially underway when work was halted due to increasing air attacks on Bremen and the lack of resources for her construction."
 RKB_carrier_3:0 "Graf Zeppelin Class"
 RKB_carrier_3_desc:0 "Graf Zeppelin was the only class of ships in the Kriegsmarine that had been designed as an aircraft carrier from the keel up. Two ships were ordered, but neither was completed. As designed, the Graf Zeppelin would carry 30 Bf-109T fighters and 12 Ju-87E dive bombers, ship versions of the Bf-109E and the Ju-87D."
 RKB_carrier_4:0 "Europa Class"
 RKB_carrier_4_desc:0 "Several civilian ships were considered for conversions to aircraft carriers by the Kriegsmarine in the 1940s. The largest of these ships was the passenger ship Europa. Being the largest passenger ship in Germany, she had been used as a barracks ship and a troop transport before work began on converting her to a carrier. Had she been completed, she would have displaced 56,000 tons and carried an air group of 42 aircraft."
 RKB_SH_battleship_1:0 "Schlachtschiff H41"
 RKB_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The H41 design of battleships was an improvement over the previous H39 design. The design called for significantly stronger armor, strengthened torpedo bulkheads and protection for the ships rudder and propeller shafts. The main battery was upgraded to eight 42cm guns, larger than that of the proposed Lion Class battleships of the United Kingdom. As designed, these ships would have a displacement of almost 70,000 tons."
 RKB_SH_battleship_2:0 "Schlachtschiff H44"
 RKB_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The H44 Class was the last of the H-series of Battleship designs. With no limit on gun caliber or displacement, the H42 to H44 designs mounted increasingly heavier armament and armor protection, culminating in the 131,000 ton H44 design armed with eight 508mm (20'') guns."

While never replacing the latter, it served alongside it and the heavier Tiger tanks until the end of the war. The Panther's excellent combination of firepower, mobility, and protection served as a benchmark for other nations' late war and post-war tank designs, and it is regarded as one of the best tanks of World War II."

 RKD_submarine_2:0 "Type IIA"
 RKD_submarine_2_desc:0 "The German Type IIA submarine was a single hull, all welded coastal submarine with internal ballast tanks. It displaced over 250 tons and mounts five 533mm torpedo tubes. Six were built between 1934 and 1935."
 #RKD_submarine_2b: "Type VIIA"
 RKD_submarine_3:0 "Type VIIC"
 RKD_submarine_3_desc:0 "The Type VIIC seagoing submarine was the workhorse of the German U-boat force, with 568 commissioned between 1940 and 1945. The ships displaced 770 tons and were armed with five 533mm torpedo tubes."
 #RKD_submarine_3b: "Type IXC"
 RKD_submarine_4:0 "Type XXI"
 RKD_submarine_4_desc:0 "Type XXI submarines, also known as 'Elektroboote', were the first submarines designed to operate primarily submerged, rather than as surface ships that could submerge as a means to escape detection or launch an attack. Its key features were its streamlined hull and conning tower and its large number of battery cells. It was among the largest of the German submarine classes, displacing over 1,620 tons. There were 118 ships commissioned between 1943 and 1945."
 RKD_destroyer_1:0 "Type 23"
 RKD_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The Type 23 was a class of torpedo boat built for the Kriegsmarine following World War I. Six vessels were built between 1926 and 1928 and all served during World War II. Despite their torpedo boat designation, the ships were destroyer-sized, displacing over 920 tons and armed with three 105mm L/45 guns."
 RKD_destroyer_2:0 "Zerstörer 1934"
 RKD_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The Zerstörer 1934 class was the first class of German destroyers built since World War I. They were armed with five 5'' guns and eight torpedo tubes. 16 ships were built, out of which 12 were the improved Zerstörer 1934A subclass."
 RKD_destroyer_3:0 "Narvik Class"
 RKD_destroyer_3_desc:0 "Zerstörer 1936A, known to the allies as Narvik Class destroyers, was designed to carry the new 150mm (5.9'') guns. Designed with three single guns aft and a twin gun in the bow, they were originally fitted with a single gun in the bow. Four of the eight ships of the class were later refitted with the twin turrets. A second group of seven destroyers were built to a slightly modified design with twin guns in the bow."
 RKD_destroyer_4:0 "Zerstörer 1944"
 RKD_destroyer_4_desc:0 "Although the first prototype of a diesel powered destroyer (Zerstörer 1942) was not completed, the development of the ship type continued. Several proposals were made which finally lead to the Zerstörer 1944 project. In addition to a heavy main armament, the ships had an increased Flak armament compared to its predecessors, including the new 5,5 cm AA gun."
 RKD_light_cruiser_1:0 "Emden Class"
 RKD_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "Emden was the first large warship built in Germany after World War I. She was laid down in 1921 and commissioned in 1925. The armament consisted of eight 150mm (5.9'') guns in single turrets."
 #RKD_light_cruiser_1b: "Königsberg Class"
 RKD_light_cruiser_2:1 "Leipzig Class"
 RKD_light_cruiser_2_desc:1 "The Leipzig-class light cruisers were built between 1928 and 1935 as improvements over the preceding Königsberg-class cruisers. They displaced over 8,100 tons, had adequate speed and range, and were armed with nine 15cm SK C/25 guns in their main armament."
 RKD_light_cruiser_3:0 "M Class"
 RKD_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The M-class cruisers were designed as scouts for commerce raiding squadrons. Six ships were ordered as part of Plan Z, with two being laid down before work was halted at the outbreak of the war. The main armament would have been eight 150mm guns in four twin turrets."
 RKD_light_cruiser_4:0 "Q Class"
 RKD_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Q-class cruisers were a modified M-class design. They were designed to be larger than the M-class with a heavier anti-aircraft armament and improved fire control."
 RKD_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Blücher Class"
 RKD_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "Blücher was the last armored cruiser built by Germany. Her design was innovative for her time and paved the way for the later Von der Tann-class Battlecruisers. By World War I, she was already obsolete. Blücher was sunk at the Battle at the Doggerbank in 1915."
 RKD_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Hipper Class"
 RKD_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Admiral Hipper Class heavy cruisers were the first heavy cruisers of the Kriegsmarine. Officially displacing 10,000 tons, in reality they displaced over 16000 tons. They were armed with eight 8'' guns in four twin turrets, with a secondary battery of twelve 105mm guns."
 RKD_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Prinz Eugen Class"
 RKD_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "Officially part of the Hipper Class, the Prinz Eugen subclass incorporates many improvements, including a heavier anti air armament. Of the three ships in the subclass, only Prinz Eugen was completed. She participated in the sinking of HMS Hood during Operation Rheinübung. After the war, she was transferred to the United States and served as USS Prinz Eugen in the Able and Baker atomic bomb tests before sinking at the Kwajalein Atoll in 1946."
 RKD_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "P Class Cruiser"
 RKD_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The P Class was a large heavy cruiser design, officially designated as Panzerschiff (Armored Ship) by the Kriegsmarine. Displacing almost 24,000 tons, they would have been 3,000 tons lighter but 55 meters longer than the U.S. New York-class battleships. The armament consisted of six 280mm guns in two triple turrets."
 RKD_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Yorck Class"
 RKD_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The three ships of the Yorck-class battlecruisers were designed in response to the British Renown Class. They would have been armed with eight 380mm guns in four twin turrets. All three ships were laid down in 1916, but none were completed due to the war."
 RKD_battle_cruiser_2:0 "O Class"
 RKD_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "In 1939, the Kriegsmarine decided to replace three of the planned P-class cruisers with battlecruisers. This resulted in the O-class battlecruisers, armed with six 38cm (15'') guns in three twin turrets. The ships were designed with a displacement of 35,400 tons and a top speed of 35 knots. Construction orders were given for the three ships of the class, but none were started."
 RKD_battleship_1:0 "Deutschland Class"
 RKD_battleship_1_desc:0 "Following the Treaty of Versailles, Germany was allowed to retain six pre-dreadnought battleships. Classified as Linienschiffe (Ships of the Line) by the Kriegsmarine, only two ships of the Deutschland Class, not to be confused with the later Deutschland-class Pocket Battleships, remained in active service through the 1930s. At 04:47 on September 1, 1939, Schleswig-Holstein fired the first shots of World War II as she opened fire on the Westerplatte base in Danzig, Poland."
 RKD_battleship_2:0 "Scharnhorst Class"
 RKD_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Scharnhorst-class battleships were the first modern battleships to be built for the Kriegsmarine. They were built as a response to the French Dunkerque-class battlecruisers, themselves a response to the German Deutschland-class Panzerschiffe (Pocket Battleships). The Scharnhorst class is armed with nine 283mm (11") guns in three triple turrets. Plans were made to up gun them with twin 380mm (15") guns, but with the outbreak of the war, this never happened."
 RKD_battleship_3:0 "Bismarck Class"
 RKD_battleship_3_desc:0 "The two-ship Bismarck-class battleships were the largest warships built for the Kriegsmarine. The ships were designed in response to the new French battleships under construction, with a similar armament of eight 38cm (15'') guns as the Richelieu Class, with four twin turrets as opposed to the two quad turrets of the Richelieus. Bismarck is famous for the sinking of the British battlecruiser HMS Hood in the Battle of the Denmark Strait, but was subsequently hunted down and sunk before reaching port."
 RKD_battleship_4:0 "Hindenburg Class"
 RKD_battleship_4_desc:0 "The German Plan Z envisioned a force of ten battleships in order to challenge the naval power of the United Kingdom. The H-class was a series of designs for the six battleships needed to meet the demands of the plan. Two ships of the H39 design were laid down at the outbreak of World War II, but construction was halted as the war begun. Neither of the ships were officially named, but Hindenburg was speculated as a possible name for the lead ship of the class. Had the ships been completed, they would have been augmented Bismarck Class ships, with a main battery of eight 40.6cm (16'') guns."
 RKD_carrier_1:0 "Flugzeugdampfer I"
 RKD_carrier_1_desc:0 "Designed in 1915, the Flugzeugdampfer I (Airplane Steamer I) Project was a conversion of the incomplete passenger liner Ausonia into an aircraft carrier. The construction was abandoned at the end of World War I. Had she been completed, she would have carried a mix of seaplanes and wheeled aircraft in her three hangars and would have displaced 12,500 tons."
 RKD_carrier_2:0 "Seydlitz Class"
 RKD_carrier_2_desc:0 "Seydlitz was laid down as the fourth ship of the Admiral Hipper-class heavy cruisers. Partially completed by the beginning of the war, she was considered for conversion into an aircraft carrier. The project, codenamed Weser 1, was partially underway when work was halted due to increasing air attacks on Bremen and the lack of resources for her construction."
 RKD_carrier_3:0 "Graf Zeppelin Class"
 RKD_carrier_3_desc:0 "Graf Zeppelin was the only class of ships in the Kriegsmarine that had been designed as an aircraft carrier from the keel up. Two ships were ordered, but neither was completed. As designed, the Graf Zeppelin would carry 30 Bf-109T fighters and 12 Ju-87E dive bombers, ship versions of the Bf-109E and the Ju-87D."
 RKD_carrier_4:0 "Europa Class"
 RKD_carrier_4_desc:0 "Several civilian ships were considered for conversions to aircraft carriers by the Kriegsmarine in the 1940s. The largest of these ships was the passenger ship Europa. Being the largest passenger ship in Germany, she had been used as a barracks ship and a troop transport before work began on converting her to a carrier. Had she been completed, she would have displaced 56,000 tons and carried an air group of 42 aircraft."
 RKD_SH_battleship_1:0 "Schlachtschiff H41"
 RKD_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The H41 design of battleships was an improvement over the previous H39 design. The design called for significantly stronger armor, strengthened torpedo bulkheads and protection for the ships rudder and propeller shafts. The main battery was upgraded to eight 42cm guns, larger than that of the proposed Lion Class battleships of the United Kingdom. As designed, these ships would have a displacement of almost 70,000 tons."
 RKD_SH_battleship_2:0 "Schlachtschiff H44"
 RKD_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The H44 Class was the last of the H-series of Battleship designs. With no limit on gun caliber or displacement, the H42 to H44 designs mounted increasingly heavier armament and armor protection, culminating in the 131,000 ton H44 design armed with eight 508mm (20'') guns."

 RKN_medium_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "As early as 1934/35, General Heinz Guderian envisioned two basic types to act as the most numerous equipment for the future German Panzer Divisions. The first vehicle was to be armed with anti-tank gun and two machine guns and the second one was to be a support vehicle armed with a larger caliber gun. The first one eventually became known as Panzerkampfwagen III, which was to be a standard tank for the three light companies of a tank battalion. The second one became known as Panzerkampfwagen IV."

However, with the flaws of pre-war doctrine becoming apparent and in the face of Soviet T-34 tanks, the Panzer IV soon assumed the tank-fighting role of its increasingly obsolete cousin. The most widely manufactured and deployed German tank of the Second World War, the Panzer IV was used as the base for many other fighting vehicles."

It was intended as a counter to the Russian T-34, and as a replacement for the Panzer III and Panzer IV. While never replacing the latter, it served alongside it and the heavier Tiger tanks until the end of the war. The Panther's excellent combination of firepower, mobility, and protection served as a benchmark for other nations' late war and post-war tank designs, and it is regarded as one of the best tanks of World War II."

It was developed in 1944 as a successor to the earlier Flakpanzer IV. The Panzer IV's turret was removed and replaced with an open-top, hexagonal turret which housed a 3.7 cm FlaK 43. A closed-top design would have been preferable, but this was not possible due to the heavy smoke generated by the gun."

 #RKN_submarine_3b: "Type IXC"
 RKN_submarine_4:0 "Type XXI"
 RKN_submarine_4_desc:0 "Type XXI submarines, also known as 'Elektroboote', were the first submarines designed to operate primarily submerged, rather than as surface ships that could submerge as a means to escape detection or launch an attack. Its key features were its streamlined hull and conning tower and its large number of battery cells. It was among the largest of the German submarine classes, displacing over 1,620 tons. There were 118 ships commissioned between 1943 and 1945."
 RKN_destroyer_1:0 "Type 23"
 RKN_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The Type 23 was a class of torpedo boat built for the Kriegsmarine following World War I. Six vessels were built between 1926 and 1928 and all served during World War II. Despite their torpedo boat designation, the ships were destroyer-sized, displacing over 920 tons and armed with three 105mm L/45 guns."
 RKN_destroyer_2:0 "Zerstörer 1934"
 RKN_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The Zerstörer 1934 class was the first class of German destroyers built since World War I. They were armed with five 5'' guns and eight torpedo tubes. 16 ships were built, out of which 12 were the improved Zerstörer 1934A subclass."
 RKN_destroyer_3:0 "Narvik Class"
 RKN_destroyer_3_desc:0 "Zerstörer 1936A, known to the allies as Narvik Class destroyers, was designed to carry the new 150mm (5.9'') guns. Designed with three single guns aft and a twin gun in the bow, they were originally fitted with a single gun in the bow. Four of the eight ships of the class were later refitted with the twin turrets. A second group of seven destroyers were built to a slightly modified design with twin guns in the bow."
 RKN_destroyer_4:0 "Zerstörer 1944"
 RKN_destroyer_4_desc:0 "Although the first prototype of a diesel powered destroyer (Zerstörer 1942) was not completed, the development of the ship type continued. Several proposals were made which finally lead to the Zerstörer 1944 project. In addition to a heavy main armament, the ships had an increased Flak armament compared to its predecessors, including the new 5,5 cm AA gun."
 RKN_light_cruiser_1:0 "Emden Class"
 RKN_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "Emden was the first large warship built in Germany after World War I. She was laid down in 1921 and commissioned in 1925. The armament consisted of eight 150mm (5.9'') guns in single turrets."
 #RKN_light_cruiser_1b: "Königsberg Class"

 RKN_light_cruiser_3:0 "M Class"
 RKN_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The M-class cruisers were designed as scouts for commerce raiding squadrons. Six ships were ordered as part of Plan Z, with two being laid down before work was halted at the outbreak of the war. The main armament would have been eight 150mm guns in four twin turrets."
 RKN_light_cruiser_4:0 "Q Class"
 RKN_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Q-class cruisers were a modified M-class design. They were designed to be larger than the M-class with a heavier anti-aircraft armament and improved fire control."
 RKN_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Blücher Class"
 RKN_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "Blücher was the last armored cruiser built by Germany. Her design was innovative for her time and paved the way for the later Von der Tann-class Battlecruisers. By World War I, she was already obsolete. Blücher was sunk at the Battle at the Doggerbank in 1915."
 RKN_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Hipper Class"
 RKN_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Admiral Hipper Class heavy cruisers were the first heavy cruisers of the Kriegsmarine. Officially displacing 10,000 tons, in reality they displaced over 16000 tons. They were armed with eight 8'' guns in four twin turrets, with a secondary battery of twelve 105mm guns."
 RKN_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Prinz Eugen Class"
 RKN_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "Officially part of the Hipper Class, the Prinz Eugen subclass incorporates many improvements, including a heavier anti air armament. Of the three ships in the subclass, only Prinz Eugen was completed. She participated in the sinking of HMS Hood during Operation Rheinübung. After the war, she was transferred to the United States and served as USS Prinz Eugen in the Able and Baker atomic bomb tests before sinking at the Kwajalein Atoll in 1946."
 RKN_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "P Class Cruiser"
 RKN_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The P Class was a large heavy cruiser design, officially designated as Panzerschiff (Armored Ship) by the Kriegsmarine. Displacing almost 24,000 tons, they would have been 3,000 tons lighter but 55 meters longer than the U.S. New York-class battleships. The armament consisted of six 280mm guns in two triple turrets."
 RKN_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Yorck Class"
 RKN_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The three ships of the Yorck-class battlecruisers were designed in response to the British Renown Class. They would have been armed with eight 380mm guns in four twin turrets. All three ships were laid down in 1916, but none were completed due to the war."
 RKN_battle_cruiser_2:0 "O Class"
 RKN_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "In 1939, the Kriegsmarine decided to replace three of the planned P-class cruisers with battlecruisers. This resulted in the O-class battlecruisers, armed with six 38cm (15'') guns in three twin turrets. The ships were designed with a displacement of 35,400 tons and a top speed of 35 knots. Construction orders were given for the three ships of the class, but none were started."
 RKN_battleship_1:0 "Deutschland Class"
 RKN_battleship_1_desc:0 "Following the Treaty of Versailles, Germany was allowed to retain six pre-dreadnought battleships. Classified as Linienschiffe (Ships of the Line) by the Kriegsmarine, only two ships of the Deutschland Class, not to be confused with the later Deutschland-class Pocket Battleships, remained in active service through the 1930s. At 04:47 on September 1, 1939, Schleswig-Holstein fired the first shots of World War II as she opened fire on the Westerplatte base in Danzig, Poland."
 RKN_battleship_2:0 "Scharnhorst Class"
 RKN_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Scharnhorst-class battleships were the first modern battleships to be built for the Kriegsmarine. They were built as a response to the French Dunkerque-class battlecruisers, themselves a response to the German Deutschland-class Panzerschiffe (Pocket Battleships). The Scharnhorst class is armed with nine 283mm (11") guns in three triple turrets. Plans were made to up gun them with twin 380mm (15") guns, but with the outbreak of the war, this never happened."
 RKN_battleship_3:0 "Bismarck Class"
 RKN_battleship_3_desc:0 "The two-ship Bismarck-class battleships were the largest warships built for the Kriegsmarine. The ships were designed in response to the new French battleships under construction, with a similar armament of eight 38cm (15'') guns as the Richelieu Class, with four twin turrets as opposed to the two quad turrets of the Richelieus. Bismarck is famous for the sinking of the British battlecruiser HMS Hood in the Battle of the Denmark Strait, but was subsequently hunted down and sunk before reaching port."
 RKN_battleship_4:0 "Hindenburg Class"
 RKN_battleship_4_desc:0 "The German Plan Z envisioned a force of ten battleships in order to challenge the naval power of the United Kingdom. The H-class was a series of designs for the six battleships needed to meet the demands of the plan. Two ships of the H39 design were laid down at the outbreak of World War II, but construction was halted as the war begun. Neither of the ships were officially named, but Hindenburg was speculated as a possible name for the lead ship of the class. Had the ships been completed, they would have been augmented Bismarck Class ships, with a main battery of eight 40.6cm (16'') guns."
 RKN_carrier_1:0 "Flugzeugdampfer I"
 RKN_carrier_1_desc:0 "Designed in 1915, the Flugzeugdampfer I (Airplane Steamer I) Project was a conversion of the incomplete passenger liner Ausonia into an aircraft carrier. The construction was abandoned at the end of World War I. Had she been completed, she would have carried a mix of seaplanes and wheeled aircraft in her three hangars and would have displaced 12,500 tons."
 RKN_carrier_2:0 "Seydlitz Class"
 RKN_carrier_2_desc:0 "Seydlitz was laid down as the fourth ship of the Admiral Hipper-class heavy cruisers. Partially completed by the beginning of the war, she was considered for conversion into an aircraft carrier. The project, codenamed Weser 1, was partially underway when work was halted due to increasing air attacks on Bremen and the lack of resources for her construction."
 RKN_carrier_3:0 "Graf Zeppelin Class"
 RKN_carrier_3_desc:0 "Graf Zeppelin was the only class of ships in the Kriegsmarine that had been designed as an aircraft carrier from the keel up. Two ships were ordered, but neither was completed. As designed, the Graf Zeppelin would carry 30 Bf-109T fighters and 12 Ju-87E dive bombers, ship versions of the Bf-109E and the Ju-87D."
 RKN_carrier_4:0 "Europa Class"
 RKN_carrier_4_desc:0 "Several civilian ships were considered for conversions to aircraft carriers by the Kriegsmarine in the 1940s. The largest of these ships was the passenger ship Europa. Being the largest passenger ship in Germany, she had been used as a barracks ship and a troop transport before work began on converting her to a carrier. Had she been completed, she would have displaced 56,000 tons and carried an air group of 42 aircraft."
 RKN_SH_battleship_1:0 "Schlachtschiff H41"
 RKN_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The H41 design of battleships was an improvement over the previous H39 design. The design called for significantly stronger armor, strengthened torpedo bulkheads and protection for the ships rudder and propeller shafts. The main battery was upgraded to eight 42cm guns, larger than that of the proposed Lion Class battleships of the United Kingdom. As designed, these ships would have a displacement of almost 70,000 tons."
 RKN_SH_battleship_2:0 "Schlachtschiff H44"

 RKK_medium_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "As early as 1934/35, General Heinz Guderian envisioned two basic types to act as the most numerous equipment for the future German Panzer Divisions. The first vehicle was to be armed with anti-tank gun and two machine guns and the second one was to be a support vehicle armed with a larger caliber gun. The first one eventually became known as Panzerkampfwagen III, which was to be a standard tank for the three light companies of a tank battalion.

While never replacing the latter, it served alongside it and the heavier Tiger tanks until the end of the war. The Panther's excellent combination of firepower, mobility, and protection served as a benchmark for other nations' late war and post-war tank designs, and it is regarded as one of the best tanks of World War II."

 #RKK_submarine_3b: "Type IXC"
 RKK_submarine_4:0 "Type XXI"
 RKK_submarine_4_desc:0 "Type XXI submarines, also known as 'Elektroboote', were the first submarines designed to operate primarily submerged, rather than as surface ships that could submerge as a means to escape detection or launch an attack. Its key features were its streamlined hull and conning tower and its large number of battery cells. It was among the largest of the German submarine classes, displacing over 1,620 tons. There were 118 ships commissioned between 1943 and 1945."
 RKK_destroyer_1:0 "Type 23"
 RKK_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The Type 23 was a class of torpedo boat built for the Kriegsmarine following World War I. Six vessels were built between 1926 and 1928 and all served during World War II. Despite their torpedo boat designation, the ships were destroyer-sized, displacing over 920 tons and armed with three 105mm L/45 guns."
 RKK_destroyer_2:0 "Zerstörer 1934"
 RKK_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The Zerstörer 1934 class was the first class of German destroyers built since World War I. They were armed with five 5'' guns and eight torpedo tubes. 16 ships were built, out of which 12 were the improved Zerstörer 1934A subclass."
 RKK_destroyer_3:0 "Narvik Class"
 RKK_destroyer_3_desc:0 "Zerstörer 1936A, known to the allies as Narvik Class destroyers, was designed to carry the new 150mm (5.9'') guns. Designed with three single guns aft and a twin gun in the bow, they were originally fitted with a single gun in the bow. Four of the eight ships of the class were later refitted with the twin turrets. A second group of seven destroyers were built to a slightly modified design with twin guns in the bow."
 RKK_destroyer_4:0 "Zerstörer 1944"
 RKK_destroyer_4_desc:0 "Although the first prototype of a diesel powered destroyer (Zerstörer 1942) was not completed, the development of the ship type continued. Several proposals were made which finally lead to the Zerstörer 1944 project. In addition to a heavy main armament, the ships had an increased Flak armament compared to its predecessors, including the new 5,5 cm AA gun."
 RKK_light_cruiser_1:0 "Emden Class"
 RKK_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "Emden was the first large warship built in Germany after World War I. She was laid down in 1921 and commissioned in 1925. The armament consisted of eight 150mm (5.9'') guns in single turrets."
 #RKK_light_cruiser_1b: "Königsberg Class"
 RKK_light_cruiser_2:1 "Leipzig Class"
 RKK_light_cruiser_2_desc:1 "The Leipzig-class light cruisers were built between 1928 and 1935 as improvements over the preceding Königsberg-class cruisers. They displaced over 8,100 tons, had adequate speed and range, and were armed with nine 15cm SK C/25 guns in their main armament."
 RKK_light_cruiser_3:0 "M Class"
 RKK_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The M-class cruisers were designed as scouts for commerce raiding squadrons. Six ships were ordered as part of Plan Z, with two being laid down before work was halted at the outbreak of the war. The main armament would have been eight 150mm guns in four twin turrets."
 RKK_light_cruiser_4:0 "Q Class"
 RKK_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Q-class cruisers were a modified M-class design. They were designed to be larger than the M-class with a heavier anti-aircraft armament and improved fire control."
 RKK_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Blücher Class"
 RKK_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "Blücher was the last armored cruiser built by Germany. Her design was innovative for her time and paved the way for the later Von der Tann-class Battlecruisers. By World War I, she was already obsolete. Blücher was sunk at the Battle at the Doggerbank in 1915."
 RKK_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Hipper Class"
 RKK_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Admiral Hipper Class heavy cruisers were the first heavy cruisers of the Kriegsmarine. Officially displacing 10,000 tons, in reality they displaced over 16000 tons.

 RKK_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Prinz Eugen Class"
 RKK_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "Officially part of the Hipper Class, the Prinz Eugen subclass incorporates many improvements, including a heavier anti air armament. Of the three ships in the subclass, only Prinz Eugen was completed. She participated in the sinking of HMS Hood during Operation Rheinübung. After the war, she was transferred to the United States and served as USS Prinz Eugen in the Able and Baker atomic bomb tests before sinking at the Kwajalein Atoll in 1946."
 RKK_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "P Class Cruiser"
 RKK_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The P Class was a large heavy cruiser design, officially designated as Panzerschiff (Armored Ship) by the Kriegsmarine. Displacing almost 24,000 tons, they would have been 3,000 tons lighter but 55 meters longer than the U.S. New York-class battleships. The armament consisted of six 280mm guns in two triple turrets."
 RKK_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Yorck Class"
 RKK_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The three ships of the Yorck-class battlecruisers were designed in response to the British Renown Class. They would have been armed with eight 380mm guns in four twin turrets. All three ships were laid down in 1916, but none were completed due to the war."
 RKK_battle_cruiser_2:0 "O Class"
 RKK_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "In 1939, the Kriegsmarine decided to replace three of the planned P-class cruisers with battlecruisers. This resulted in the O-class battlecruisers, armed with six 38cm (15'') guns in three twin turrets. The ships were designed with a displacement of 35,400 tons and a top speed of 35 knots. Construction orders were given for the three ships of the class, but none were started."
 RKK_battleship_1:0 "Deutschland Class"
 RKK_battleship_1_desc:0 "Following the Treaty of Versailles, Germany was allowed to retain six pre-dreadnought battleships. Classified as Linienschiffe (Ships of the Line) by the Kriegsmarine, only two ships of the Deutschland Class, not to be confused with the later Deutschland-class Pocket Battleships, remained in active service through the 1930s. At 04:47 on September 1, 1939, Schleswig-Holstein fired the first shots of World War II as she opened fire on the Westerplatte base in Danzig, Poland."
 RKK_battleship_2:0 "Scharnhorst Class"
 RKK_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Scharnhorst-class battleships were the first modern battleships to be built for the Kriegsmarine. They were built as a response to the French Dunkerque-class battlecruisers, themselves a response to the German Deutschland-class Panzerschiffe (Pocket Battleships). The Scharnhorst class is armed with nine 283mm (11") guns in three triple turrets. Plans were made to up gun them with twin 380mm (15") guns, but with the outbreak of the war, this never happened."
 RKK_battleship_3:0 "Bismarck Class"
 RKK_battleship_3_desc:0 "The two-ship Bismarck-class battleships were the largest warships built for the Kriegsmarine. The ships were designed in response to the new French battleships under construction, with a similar armament of eight 38cm (15'') guns as the Richelieu Class, with four twin turrets as opposed to the two quad turrets of the Richelieus. Bismarck is famous for the sinking of the British battlecruiser HMS Hood in the Battle of the Denmark Strait, but was subsequently hunted down and sunk before reaching port."
 RKK_battleship_4:0 "Hindenburg Class"
 RKK_battleship_4_desc:0 "The German Plan Z envisioned a force of ten battleships in order to challenge the naval power of the United Kingdom. The H-class was a series of designs for the six battleships needed to meet the demands of the plan. Two ships of the H39 design were laid down at the outbreak of World War II, but construction was halted as the war begun. Neither of the ships were officially named, but Hindenburg was speculated as a possible name for the lead ship of the class. Had the ships been completed, they would have been augmented Bismarck Class ships, with a main battery of eight 40.6cm (16'') guns."
 RKK_carrier_1:0 "Flugzeugdampfer I"
 RKK_carrier_1_desc:0 "Designed in 1915, the Flugzeugdampfer I (Airplane Steamer I) Project was a conversion of the incomplete passenger liner Ausonia into an aircraft carrier. The construction was abandoned at the end of World War I. Had she been completed, she would have carried a mix of seaplanes and wheeled aircraft in her three hangars and would have displaced 12,500 tons."
 RKK_carrier_2:0 "Seydlitz Class"
 RKK_carrier_2_desc:0 "Seydlitz was laid down as the fourth ship of the Admiral Hipper-class heavy cruisers. Partially completed by the beginning of the war, she was considered for conversion into an aircraft carrier. The project, codenamed Weser 1, was partially underway when work was halted due to increasing air attacks on Bremen and the lack of resources for her construction."
 RKK_carrier_3:0 "Graf Zeppelin Class"
 RKK_carrier_3_desc:0 "Graf Zeppelin was the only class of ships in the Kriegsmarine that had been designed as an aircraft carrier from the keel up. Two ships were ordered, but neither was completed. As designed, the Graf Zeppelin would carry 30 Bf-109T fighters and 12 Ju-87E dive bombers, ship versions of the Bf-109E and the Ju-87D."
 RKK_carrier_4:0 "Europa Class"
 RKK_carrier_4_desc:0 "Several civilian ships were considered for conversions to aircraft carriers by the Kriegsmarine in the 1940s. The largest of these ships was the passenger ship Europa. Being the largest passenger ship in Germany, she had been used as a barracks ship and a troop transport before work began on converting her to a carrier. Had she been completed, she would have displaced 56,000 tons and carried an air group of 42 aircraft."
 RKK_SH_battleship_1:0 "Schlachtschiff H41"
 RKK_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The H41 design of battleships was an improvement over the previous H39 design. The design called for significantly stronger armor, strengthened torpedo bulkheads and protection for the ships rudder and propeller shafts. The main battery was upgraded to eight 42cm guns, larger than that of the proposed Lion Class battleships of the United Kingdom. As designed, these ships would have a displacement of almost 70,000 tons."
 RKK_SH_battleship_2:0 "Schlachtschiff H44"
 RKK_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The H44 Class was the last of the H-series of Battleship designs. With no limit on gun caliber or displacement, the H42 to H44 designs mounted increasingly heavier armament and armor protection, culminating in the 131,000 ton H44 design armed with eight 508mm (20'') guns."

 RKM_medium_tank_equipment_1_short:0 "Panzer III"
 RKM_medium_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "As early as 1934/35, General Heinz Guderian envisioned two basic types to act as the most numerous equipment for the future German Panzer Divisions. The first vehicle was to be armed with anti-tank gun and two machine guns and the second one was to be a support vehicle armed with a larger caliber gun. The first one eventually became known as Panzerkampfwagen III, which was to be a standard tank for the three light companies of a tank battalion. The second one became known as Panzerkampfwagen IV."
 
 RKM_medium_tank_equipment_2:0 "Panzerkampfwagen IV"
 RKM_medium_tank_equipment_2_short:0 "Panzer IV"
 RKM_medium_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "Designed as an infantry-support tank, the Panzer IV was not originally intended to engage enemy armor - that function was performed by the lighter Panzer III. However, with the flaws of pre-war doctrine becoming apparent and in the face of Soviet T-34 tanks, the Panzer IV soon assumed the tank-fighting role of its increasingly obsolete cousin. The most widely manufactured and deployed German tank of the Second World War, the Panzer IV was used as the base for many other fighting vehicles."

 RKM_medium_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "Panther is the common name of a medium tank deployed by Germany in World War II from mid-1943 to the end of the European war in 1945. It was intended as a counter to the Russian T-34, and as a replacement for the Panzer III and Panzer IV. While never replacing the latter, it served alongside it and the heavier Tiger tanks until the end of the war. The Panther's excellent combination of firepower, mobility, and protection served as a benchmark for other nations' late war and post-war tank designs, and it is regarded as one of the best tanks of World War II."

 RKM_medium_tank_destroyer_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Jagdpanzer IV served in the anti-tank sections of Panzer and SS Panzer divisions. They fought in Normandy, the Battle of the Bulge and on the Eastern Front. They were very successful tank destroyers but performed badly when used out of role as substitutes for tanks or assault guns, as most tank destroyers were. In the later stages of the war however, they were increasingly used as tank substitutes, because there was often nothing else available."

 RKM_submarine_2:0 "Type IIA"
 RKM_submarine_2_desc:0 "The German Type IIA submarine was a single hull, all welded coastal submarine with internal ballast tanks. It displaced over 250 tons and mounts five 533mm torpedo tubes. Six were built between 1934 and 1935."
 #RKM_submarine_2b: "Type VIIA"
 RKM_submarine_3:0 "Type VIIC"
 RKM_submarine_3_desc:0 "The Type VIIC seagoing submarine was the workhorse of the German U-boat force, with 568 commissioned between 1940 and 1945. The ships displaced 770 tons and were armed with five 533mm torpedo tubes."
 #RKM_submarine_3b: "Type IXC"
 RKM_submarine_4:0 "Type XXI"
 RKM_submarine_4_desc:0 "Type XXI submarines, also known as 'Elektroboote', were the first submarines designed to operate primarily submerged, rather than as surface ships that could submerge as a means to escape detection or launch an attack. Its key features were its streamlined hull and conning tower and its large number of battery cells. It was among the largest of the German submarine classes, displacing over 1,620 tons. There were 118 ships commissioned between 1943 and 1945."
 RKM_destroyer_1:0 "Type 23"
 RKM_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The Type 23 was a class of torpedo boat built for the Kriegsmarine following World War I. Six vessels were built between 1926 and 1928 and all served during World War II. Despite their torpedo boat designation, the ships were destroyer-sized, displacing over 920 tons and armed with three 105mm L/45 guns."
 RKM_destroyer_2:0 "Zerstörer 1934"
 RKM_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The Zerstörer 1934 class was the first class of German destroyers built since World War I. They were armed with five 5'' guns and eight torpedo tubes. 16 ships were built, out of which 12 were the improved Zerstörer 1934A subclass."
 RKM_destroyer_3:0 "Narvik Class"
 RKM_destroyer_3_desc:0 "Zerstörer 1936A, known to the allies as Narvik Class destroyers, was designed to carry the new 150mm (5.9'') guns. Designed with three single guns aft and a twin gun in the bow, they were originally fitted with a single gun in the bow. Four of the eight ships of the class were later refitted with the twin turrets. A second group of seven destroyers were built to a slightly modified design with twin guns in the bow."
 RKM_destroyer_4:0 "Zerstörer 1944"
 RKM_destroyer_4_desc:0 "Although the first prototype of a diesel powered destroyer (Zerstörer 1942) was not completed, the development of the ship type continued. Several proposals were made which finally lead to the Zerstörer 1944 project. In addition to a heavy main armament, the ships had an increased Flak armament compared to its predecessors, including the new 5,5 cm AA gun."
 RKM_light_cruiser_1:0 "Emden Class"
 RKM_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "Emden was the first large warship built in Germany after World War I. She was laid down in 1921 and commissioned in 1925. The armament consisted of eight 150mm (5.9'') guns in single turrets."
 #RKM_light_cruiser_1b: "Königsberg Class"
 RKM_light_cruiser_2:1 "Leipzig Class"
 RKM_light_cruiser_2_desc:1 "The Leipzig-class light cruisers were built between 1928 and 1935 as improvements over the preceding Königsberg-class cruisers. They displaced over 8,100 tons, had adequate speed and range, and were armed with nine 15cm SK C/25 guns in their main armament."
 RKM_light_cruiser_3:0 "M Class"
 RKM_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The M-class cruisers were designed as scouts for commerce raiding squadrons. Six ships were ordered as part of Plan Z, with two being laid down before work was halted at the outbreak of the war. The main armament would have been eight 150mm guns in four twin turrets."
 RKM_light_cruiser_4:0 "Q Class"
 RKM_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Q-class cruisers were a modified M-class design. They were designed to be larger than the M-class with a heavier anti-aircraft armament and improved fire control."
 RKM_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Blücher Class"
 RKM_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "Blücher was the last armored cruiser built by Germany. Her design was innovative for her time and paved the way for the later Von der Tann-class Battlecruisers. By World War I, she was already obsolete. Blücher was sunk at the Battle at the Doggerbank in 1915."
 RKM_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Hipper Class"
 RKM_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Admiral Hipper Class heavy cruisers were the first heavy cruisers of the Kriegsmarine. Officially displacing 10,000 tons, in reality they displaced over 16000 tons. They were armed with eight 8'' guns in four twin turrets, with a secondary battery of twelve 105mm guns."
 RKM_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Prinz Eugen Class"
 RKM_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "Officially part of the Hipper Class, the Prinz Eugen subclass incorporates many improvements, including a heavier anti air armament. Of the three ships in the subclass, only Prinz Eugen was completed. She participated in the sinking of HMS Hood during Operation Rheinübung. After the war, she was transferred to the United States and served as USS Prinz Eugen in the Able and Baker atomic bomb tests before sinking at the Kwajalein Atoll in 1946."
 RKM_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "P Class Cruiser"
 RKM_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The P Class was a large heavy cruiser design, officially designated as Panzerschiff (Armored Ship) by the Kriegsmarine. Displacing almost 24,000 tons, they would have been 3,000 tons lighter but 55 meters longer than the U.S. New York-class battleships. The armament consisted of six 280mm guns in two triple turrets."
 RKM_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Yorck Class"
 RKM_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The three ships of the Yorck-class battlecruisers were designed in response to the British Renown Class. They would have been armed with eight 380mm guns in four twin turrets. All three ships were laid down in 1916, but none were completed due to the war."
 RKM_battle_cruiser_2:0 "O Class"
 RKM_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "In 1939, the Kriegsmarine decided to replace three of the planned P-class cruisers with battlecruisers. This resulted in the O-class battlecruisers, armed with six 38cm (15'') guns in three twin turrets. The ships were designed with a displacement of 35,400 tons and a top speed of 35 knots. Construction orders were given for the three ships of the class, but none were started."
 RKM_battleship_1:0 "Deutschland Class"
 RKM_battleship_1_desc:0 "Following the Treaty of Versailles, Germany was allowed to retain six pre-dreadnought battleships. Classified as Linienschiffe (Ships of the Line) by the Kriegsmarine, only two ships of the Deutschland Class, not to be confused with the later Deutschland-class Pocket Battleships, remained in active service through the 1930s. At 04:47 on September 1, 1939, Schleswig-Holstein fired the first shots of World War II as she opened fire on the Westerplatte base in Danzig, Poland."
 RKM_battleship_2:0 "Scharnhorst Class"
 RKM_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Scharnhorst-class battleships were the first modern battleships to be built for the Kriegsmarine. They were built as a response to the French Dunkerque-class battlecruisers, themselves a response to the German Deutschland-class Panzerschiffe (Pocket Battleships). The Scharnhorst class is armed with nine 283mm (11") guns in three triple turrets. Plans were made to up gun them with twin 380mm (15") guns, but with the outbreak of the war, this never happened."
 RKM_battleship_3:0 "Bismarck Class"
 RKM_battleship_3_desc:0 "The two-ship Bismarck-class battleships were the largest warships built for the Kriegsmarine. The ships were designed in response to the new French battleships under construction, with a similar armament of eight 38cm (15'') guns as the Richelieu Class, with four twin turrets as opposed to the two quad turrets of the Richelieus. Bismarck is famous for the sinking of the British battlecruiser HMS Hood in the Battle of the Denmark Strait, but was subsequently hunted down and sunk before reaching port."
 RKM_battleship_4:0 "Hindenburg Class"
 RKM_battleship_4_desc:0 "The German Plan Z envisioned a force of ten battleships in order to challenge the naval power of the United Kingdom. The H-class was a series of designs for the six battleships needed to meet the demands of the plan. Two ships of the H39 design were laid down at the outbreak of World War II, but construction was halted as the war begun. Neither of the ships were officially named, but Hindenburg was speculated as a possible name for the lead ship of the class. Had the ships been completed, they would have been augmented Bismarck Class ships, with a main battery of eight 40.6cm (16'') guns."
 RKM_carrier_1:0 "Flugzeugdampfer I"
 RKM_carrier_1_desc:0 "Designed in 1915, the Flugzeugdampfer I (Airplane Steamer I) Project was a conversion of the incomplete passenger liner Ausonia into an aircraft carrier. The construction was abandoned at the end of World War I. Had she been completed, she would have carried a mix of seaplanes and wheeled aircraft in her three hangars and would have displaced 12,500 tons."
 RKM_carrier_2:0 "Seydlitz Class"
 RKM_carrier_2_desc:0 "Seydlitz was laid down as the fourth ship of the Admiral Hipper-class heavy cruisers. Partially completed by the beginning of the war, she was considered for conversion into an aircraft carrier. The project, codenamed Weser 1, was partially underway when work was halted due to increasing air attacks on Bremen and the lack of resources for her construction."
 RKM_carrier_3:0 "Graf Zeppelin Class"
 RKM_carrier_3_desc:0 "Graf Zeppelin was the only class of ships in the Kriegsmarine that had been designed as an aircraft carrier from the keel up. Two ships were ordered, but neither was completed. As designed, the Graf Zeppelin would carry 30 Bf-109T fighters and 12 Ju-87E dive bombers, ship versions of the Bf-109E and the Ju-87D."
 RKM_carrier_4:0 "Europa Class"
 RKM_carrier_4_desc:0 "Several civilian ships were considered for conversions to aircraft carriers by the Kriegsmarine in the 1940s. The largest of these ships was the passenger ship Europa. Being the largest passenger ship in Germany, she had been used as a barracks ship and a troop transport before work began on converting her to a carrier. Had she been completed, she would have displaced 56,000 tons and carried an air group of 42 aircraft."
 RKM_SH_battleship_1:0 "Schlachtschiff H41"
 RKM_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The H41 design of battleships was an improvement over the previous H39 design. The design called for significantly stronger armor, strengthened torpedo bulkheads and protection for the ships rudder and propeller shafts. The main battery was upgraded to eight 42cm guns, larger than that of the proposed Lion Class battleships of the United Kingdom. As designed, these ships would have a displacement of almost 70,000 tons."
 RKM_SH_battleship_2:0 "Schlachtschiff H44"
 RKM_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The H44 Class was the last of the H-series of Battleship designs. With no limit on gun caliber or displacement, the H42 to H44 designs mounted increasingly heavier armament and armor protection, culminating in the 131,000 ton H44 design armed with eight 508mm (20'') guns."

The first vehicle was to be armed with anti-tank gun and two machine guns and the second one was to be a support vehicle armed with a larger caliber gun. The first one eventually became known as Panzerkampfwagen III, which was to be a standard tank for the three light companies of a tank battalion. The second one became known as Panzerkampfwagen IV."

 RKG_medium_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "Designed as an infantry-support tank, the Panzer IV was not originally intended to engage enemy armor - that function was performed by the lighter Panzer III. However, with the flaws of pre-war doctrine becoming apparent and in the face of Soviet T-34 tanks, the Panzer IV soon assumed the tank-fighting role of its increasingly obsolete cousin. The most widely manufactured and deployed German tank of the Second World War, the Panzer IV was used as the base for many other fighting vehicles."

It was intended as a counter to the Russian T-34, and as a replacement for the Panzer III and Panzer IV. While never replacing the latter, it served alongside it and the heavier Tiger tanks until the end of the war. The Panther's excellent combination of firepower, mobility, and protection served as a benchmark for other nations' late war and post-war tank designs, and it is regarded as one of the best tanks of World War II."

 RKG_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The three ships of the Yorck-class battlecruisers were designed in response to the British Renown Class. They would have been armed with eight 380mm guns in four twin turrets. All three ships were laid down in 1916, but none were completed due to the war."
 RKG_battle_cruiser_2:0 "O Class"
 RKG_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "In 1939, the Kriegsmarine decided to replace three of the planned P-class cruisers with battlecruisers. This resulted in the O-class battlecruisers, armed with six 38cm (15'') guns in three twin turrets. The ships were designed with a displacement of 35,400 tons and a top speed of 35 knots. Construction orders were given for the three ships of the class, but none were started."
 RKG_battleship_1:0 "Deutschland Class"
 RKG_battleship_1_desc:0 "Following the Treaty of Versailles, Germany was allowed to retain six pre-dreadnought battleships. Classified as Linienschiffe (Ships of the Line) by the Kriegsmarine, only two ships of the Deutschland Class, not to be confused with the later Deutschland-class Pocket Battleships, remained in active service through the 1930s. At 04:47 on September 1, 1939, Schleswig-Holstein fired the first shots of World War II as she opened fire on the Westerplatte base in Danzig, Poland."
 RKG_battleship_2:0 "Scharnhorst Class"
 RKG_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Scharnhorst-class battleships were the first modern battleships to be built for the Kriegsmarine. They were built as a response to the French Dunkerque-class battlecruisers, themselves a response to the German Deutschland-class Panzerschiffe (Pocket Battleships). The Scharnhorst class is armed with nine 283mm (11") guns in three triple turrets. Plans were made to up gun them with twin 380mm (15") guns, but with the outbreak of the war, this never happened."
 RKG_battleship_3:0 "Bismarck Class"
 RKG_battleship_3_desc:0 "The two-ship Bismarck-class battleships were the largest warships built for the Kriegsmarine. The ships were designed in response to the new French battleships under construction, with a similar armament of eight 38cm (15'') guns as the Richelieu Class, with four twin turrets as opposed to the two quad turrets of the Richelieus. Bismarck is famous for the sinking of the British battlecruiser HMS Hood in the Battle of the Denmark Strait, but was subsequently hunted down and sunk before reaching port."
 RKG_battleship_4:0 "Hindenburg Class"
 RKG_battleship_4_desc:0 "The German Plan Z envisioned a force of ten battleships in order to challenge the naval power of the United Kingdom. The H-class was a series of designs for the six battleships needed to meet the demands of the plan. Two ships of the H39 design were laid down at the outbreak of World War II, but construction was halted as the war begun. Neither of the ships were officially named, but Hindenburg was speculated as a possible name for the lead ship of the class. Had the ships been completed, they would have been augmented Bismarck Class ships, with a main battery of eight 40.6cm (16'') guns."
 RKG_carrier_1:0 "Flugzeugdampfer I"
 RKG_carrier_1_desc:0 "Designed in 1915, the Flugzeugdampfer I (Airplane Steamer I) Project was a conversion of the incomplete passenger liner Ausonia into an aircraft carrier. The construction was abandoned at the end of World War I. Had she been completed, she would have carried a mix of seaplanes and wheeled aircraft in her three hangars and would have displaced 12,500 tons."
 RKG_carrier_2:0 "Seydlitz Class"
 RKG_carrier_2_desc:0 "Seydlitz was laid down as the fourth ship of the Admiral Hipper-class heavy cruisers. Partially completed by the beginning of the war, she was considered for conversion into an aircraft carrier. The project, codenamed Weser 1, was partially underway when work was halted due to increasing air attacks on Bremen and the lack of resources for her construction."
 RKG_carrier_3:0 "Graf Zeppelin Class"
 RKG_carrier_3_desc:0 "Graf Zeppelin was the only class of ships in the Kriegsmarine that had been designed as an aircraft carrier from the keel up. Two ships were ordered, but neither was completed. As designed, the Graf Zeppelin would carry 30 Bf-109T fighters and 12 Ju-87E dive bombers, ship versions of the Bf-109E and the Ju-87D."
 RKG_carrier_4:0 "Europa Class"
 RKG_carrier_4_desc:0 "Several civilian ships were considered for conversions to aircraft carriers by the Kriegsmarine in the 1940s. The largest of these ships was the passenger ship Europa. Being the largest passenger ship in Germany, she had been used as a barracks ship and a troop transport before work began on converting her to a carrier. Had she been completed, she would have displaced 56,000 tons and carried an air group of 42 aircraft."
 RKG_SH_battleship_1:0 "Schlachtschiff H41"
 RKG_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The H41 design of battleships was an improvement over the previous H39 design. The design called for significantly stronger armor, strengthened torpedo bulkheads and protection for the ships rudder and propeller shafts. The main battery was upgraded to eight 42cm guns, larger than that of the proposed Lion Class battleships of the United Kingdom. As designed, these ships would have a displacement of almost 70,000 tons."
 RKG_SH_battleship_2:0 "Schlachtschiff H44"
 RKG_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The H44 Class was the last of the H-series of Battleship designs. With no limit on gun caliber or displacement, the H42 to H44 designs mounted increasingly heavier armament and armor protection, culminating in the 131,000 ton H44 design armed with eight 508mm (20'') guns."

 RKO_medium_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "As early as 1934/35, General Heinz Guderian envisioned two basic types to act as the most numerous equipment for the future German Panzer Divisions. The first vehicle was to be armed with anti-tank gun and two machine guns and the second one was to be a support vehicle armed with a larger caliber gun. The first one eventually became known as Panzerkampfwagen III, which was to be a standard tank for the three light companies of a tank battalion.

While never replacing the latter, it served alongside it and the heavier Tiger tanks until the end of the war. The Panther's excellent combination of firepower, mobility, and protection served as a benchmark for other nations' late war and post-war tank designs, and it is regarded as one of the best tanks of World War II."

 RKO_submarine_2:0 "Type IIA"
 RKO_submarine_2_desc:0 "The German Type IIA submarine was a single hull, all welded coastal submarine with internal ballast tanks. It displaced over 250 tons and mounts five 533mm torpedo tubes. Six were built between 1934 and 1935."
 #RKO_submarine_2b: "Type VIIA"
 RKO_submarine_3:0 "Type VIIC"
 RKO_submarine_3_desc:0 "The Type VIIC seagoing submarine was the workhorse of the German U-boat force, with 568 commissioned between 1940 and 1945. The ships displaced 770 tons and were armed with five 533mm torpedo tubes."
 #RKO_submarine_3b: "Type IXC"
 RKO_submarine_4:0 "Type XXI"
 RKO_submarine_4_desc:0 "Type XXI submarines, also known as 'Elektroboote', were the first submarines designed to operate primarily submerged, rather than as surface ships that could submerge as a means to escape detection or launch an attack. Its key features were its streamlined hull and conning tower and its large number of battery cells. It was among the largest of the German submarine classes, displacing over 1,620 tons. There were 118 ships commissioned between 1943 and 1945."
 RKO_destroyer_1:0 "Type 23"
 RKO_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The Type 23 was a class of torpedo boat built for the Kriegsmarine following World War I. Six vessels were built between 1926 and 1928 and all served during World War II. Despite their torpedo boat designation, the ships were destroyer-sized, displacing over 920 tons and armed with three 105mm L/45 guns."
 RKO_destroyer_2:0 "Zerstörer 1934"
 RKO_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The Zerstörer 1934 class was the first class of German destroyers built since World War I. They were armed with five 5'' guns and eight torpedo tubes. 16 ships were built, out of which 12 were the improved Zerstörer 1934A subclass."
 RKO_destroyer_3:0 "Narvik Class"
 RKO_destroyer_3_desc:0 "Zerstörer 1936A, known to the allies as Narvik Class destroyers, was designed to carry the new 150mm (5.9'') guns. Designed with three single guns aft and a twin gun in the bow, they were originally fitted with a single gun in the bow. Four of the eight ships of the class were later refitted with the twin turrets. A second group of seven destroyers were built to a slightly modified design with twin guns in the bow."
 RKO_destroyer_4:0 "Zerstörer 1944"
 RKO_destroyer_4_desc:0 "Although the first prototype of a diesel powered destroyer (Zerstörer 1942) was not completed, the development of the ship type continued. Several proposals were made which finally lead to the Zerstörer 1944 project. In addition to a heavy main armament, the ships had an increased Flak armament compared to its predecessors, including the new 5,5 cm AA gun."
 RKO_light_cruiser_1:0 "Emden Class"
 RKO_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "Emden was the first large warship built in Germany after World War I. She was laid down in 1921 and commissioned in 1925. The armament consisted of eight 150mm (5.9'') guns in single turrets."
 #RKO_light_cruiser_1b: "Königsberg Class"
 RKO_light_cruiser_2:1 "Leipzig Class"
 RKO_light_cruiser_2_desc:1 "The Leipzig-class light cruisers were built between 1928 and 1935 as improvements over the preceding Königsberg-class cruisers. They displaced over 8,100 tons, had adequate speed and range, and were armed with nine 15cm SK C/25 guns in their main armament."
 RKO_light_cruiser_3:0 "M Class"
 RKO_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The M-class cruisers were designed as scouts for commerce raiding squadrons. Six ships were ordered as part of Plan Z, with two being laid down before work was halted at the outbreak of the war. The main armament would have been eight 150mm guns in four twin turrets."
 RKO_light_cruiser_4:0 "Q Class"
 RKO_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Q-class cruisers were a modified M-class design. They were designed to be larger than the M-class with a heavier anti-aircraft armament and improved fire control."
 RKO_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Blücher Class"
 RKO_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "Blücher was the last armored cruiser built by Germany. Her design was innovative for her time and paved the way for the later Von der Tann-class Battlecruisers. By World War I, she was already obsolete. Blücher was sunk at the Battle at the Doggerbank in 1915."
 RKO_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Hipper Class"
 RKO_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Admiral Hipper Class heavy cruisers were the first heavy cruisers of the Kriegsmarine. Officially displacing 10,000 tons, in reality they displaced over 16000 tons. They were armed with eight 8'' guns in four twin turrets, with a secondary battery of twelve 105mm guns."
 RKO_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Prinz Eugen Class"
 RKO_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "Officially part of the Hipper Class, the Prinz Eugen subclass incorporates many improvements, including a heavier anti air armament. Of the three ships in the subclass, only Prinz Eugen was completed. She participated in the sinking of HMS Hood during Operation Rheinübung. After the war, she was transferred to the United States and served as USS Prinz Eugen in the Able and Baker atomic bomb tests before sinking at the Kwajalein Atoll in 1946."
 RKO_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "P Class Cruiser"
 RKO_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The P Class was a large heavy cruiser design, officially designated as Panzerschiff (Armored Ship) by the Kriegsmarine. Displacing almost 24,000 tons, they would have been 3,000 tons lighter but 55 meters longer than the U.S. New York-class battleships. The armament consisted of six 280mm guns in two triple turrets."
 RKO_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Yorck Class"
 RKO_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The three ships of the Yorck-class battlecruisers were designed in response to the British Renown Class. They would have been armed with eight 380mm guns in four twin turrets. All three ships were laid down in 1916, but none were completed due to the war."
 RKO_battle_cruiser_2:0 "O Class"
 RKO_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "In 1939, the Kriegsmarine decided to replace three of the planned P-class cruisers with battlecruisers. This resulted in the O-class battlecruisers, armed with six 38cm (15'') guns in three twin turrets. The ships were designed with a displacement of 35,400 tons and a top speed of 35 knots. Construction orders were given for the three ships of the class, but none were started."
 RKO_battleship_1:0 "Deutschland Class"
 RKO_battleship_1_desc:0 "Following the Treaty of Versailles, Germany was allowed to retain six pre-dreadnought battleships. Classified as Linienschiffe (Ships of the Line) by the Kriegsmarine, only two ships of the Deutschland Class, not to be confused with the later Deutschland-class Pocket Battleships, remained in active service through the 1930s. At 04:47 on September 1, 1939, Schleswig-Holstein fired the first shots of World War II as she opened fire on the Westerplatte base in Danzig, Poland."
 RKO_battleship_2:0 "Scharnhorst Class"
 RKO_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Scharnhorst-class battleships were the first modern battleships to be built for the Kriegsmarine. They were built as a response to the French Dunkerque-class battlecruisers, themselves a response to the German Deutschland-class Panzerschiffe (Pocket Battleships). The Scharnhorst class is armed with nine 283mm (11") guns in three triple turrets. Plans were made to up gun them with twin 380mm (15") guns, but with the outbreak of the war, this never happened."
 RKO_battleship_3:0 "Bismarck Class"
 RKO_battleship_3_desc:0 "The two-ship Bismarck-class battleships were the largest warships built for the Kriegsmarine. The ships were designed in response to the new French battleships under construction, with a similar armament of eight 38cm (15'') guns as the Richelieu Class, with four twin turrets as opposed to the two quad turrets of the Richelieus. Bismarck is famous for the sinking of the British battlecruiser HMS Hood in the Battle of the Denmark Strait, but was subsequently hunted down and sunk before reaching port."
 RKO_battleship_4:0 "Hindenburg Class"
 RKO_battleship_4_desc:0 "The German Plan Z envisioned a force of ten battleships in order to challenge the naval power of the United Kingdom. The H-class was a series of designs for the six battleships needed to meet the demands of the plan. Two ships of the H39 design were laid down at the outbreak of World War II, but construction was halted as the war begun. Neither of the ships were officially named, but Hindenburg was speculated as a possible name for the lead ship of the class. Had the ships been completed, they would have been augmented Bismarck Class ships, with a main battery of eight 40.6cm (16'') guns."
 RKO_carrier_1:0 "Flugzeugdampfer I"
 RKO_carrier_1_desc:0 "Designed in 1915, the Flugzeugdampfer I (Airplane Steamer I) Project was a conversion of the incomplete passenger liner Ausonia into an aircraft carrier. The construction was abandoned at the end of World War I. Had she been completed, she would have carried a mix of seaplanes and wheeled aircraft in her three hangars and would have displaced 12,500 tons."
 RKO_carrier_2:0 "Seydlitz Class"
 RKO_carrier_2_desc:0 "Seydlitz was laid down as the fourth ship of the Admiral Hipper-class heavy cruisers. Partially completed by the beginning of the war, she was considered for conversion into an aircraft carrier. The project, codenamed Weser 1, was partially underway when work was halted due to increasing air attacks on Bremen and the lack of resources for her construction."
 RKO_carrier_3:0 "Graf Zeppelin Class"
 RKO_carrier_3_desc:0 "Graf Zeppelin was the only class of ships in the Kriegsmarine that had been designed as an aircraft carrier from the keel up. Two ships were ordered, but neither was completed. As designed, the Graf Zeppelin would carry 30 Bf-109T fighters and 12 Ju-87E dive bombers, ship versions of the Bf-109E and the Ju-87D."
 RKO_carrier_4:0 "Europa Class"
 RKO_carrier_4_desc:0 "Several civilian ships were considered for conversions to aircraft carriers by the Kriegsmarine in the 1940s. The largest of these ships was the passenger ship Europa. Being the largest passenger ship in Germany, she had been used as a barracks ship and a troop transport before work began on converting her to a carrier. Had she been completed, she would have displaced 56,000 tons and carried an air group of 42 aircraft."
 RKO_SH_battleship_1:0 "Schlachtschiff H41"
 RKO_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The H41 design of battleships was an improvement over the previous H39 design. The design called for significantly stronger armor, strengthened torpedo bulkheads and protection for the ships rudder and propeller shafts. The main battery was upgraded to eight 42cm guns, larger than that of the proposed Lion Class battleships of the United Kingdom. As designed, these ships would have a displacement of almost 70,000 tons."
 RKO_SH_battleship_2:0 "Schlachtschiff H44"
 RKO_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The H44 Class was the last of the H-series of Battleship designs. With no limit on gun caliber or displacement, the H42 to H44 designs mounted increasingly heavier armament and armor protection, culminating in the 131,000 ton H44 design armed with eight 508mm (20'') guns."

 RKS_medium_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "As early as 1934/35, General Heinz Guderian envisioned two basic types to act as the most numerous equipment for the future German Panzer Divisions. The first vehicle was to be armed with anti-tank gun and two machine guns and the second one was to be a support vehicle armed with a larger caliber gun. The first one eventually became known as Panzerkampfwagen III, which was to be a standard tank for the three light companies of a tank battalion. The second one became known as Panzerkampfwagen IV."

However, with the flaws of pre-war doctrine becoming apparent and in the face of Soviet T-34 tanks, the Panzer IV soon assumed the tank-fighting role of its increasingly obsolete cousin. The most widely manufactured and deployed German tank of the Second World War, the Panzer IV was used as the base for many other fighting vehicles."

It was intended as a counter to the Russian T-34, and as a replacement for the Panzer III and Panzer IV. While never replacing the latter, it served alongside it and the heavier Tiger tanks until the end of the war. The Panther's excellent combination of firepower, mobility, and protection served as a benchmark for other nations' late war and post-war tank designs, and it is regarded as one of the best tanks of World War II."

 #RKS_submarine_3b: "Type IXC"
 RKS_submarine_4:0 "Type XXI"
 RKS_submarine_4_desc:0 "Type XXI submarines, also known as 'Elektroboote', were the first submarines designed to operate primarily submerged, rather than as surface ships that could submerge as a means to escape detection or launch an attack. Its key features were its streamlined hull and conning tower and its large number of battery cells. It was among the largest of the German submarine classes, displacing over 1,620 tons. There were 118 ships commissioned between 1943 and 1945."
 RKS_destroyer_1:0 "Type 23"
 RKS_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The Type 23 was a class of torpedo boat built for the Kriegsmarine following World War I. Six vessels were built between 1926 and 1928 and all served during World War II. Despite their torpedo boat designation, the ships were destroyer-sized, displacing over 920 tons and armed with three 105mm L/45 guns."
 RKS_destroyer_2:0 "Zerstörer 1934"
 RKS_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The Zerstörer 1934 class was the first class of German destroyers built since World War I. They were armed with five 5'' guns and eight torpedo tubes. 16 ships were built, out of which 12 were the improved Zerstörer 1934A subclass."
 RKS_destroyer_3:0 "Narvik Class"
 RKS_destroyer_3_desc:0 "Zerstörer 1936A, known to the allies as Narvik Class destroyers, was designed to carry the new 150mm (5.9'') guns. Designed with three single guns aft and a twin gun in the bow, they were originally fitted with a single gun in the bow. Four of the eight ships of the class were later refitted with the twin turrets. A second group of seven destroyers were built to a slightly modified design with twin guns in the bow."
 RKS_destroyer_4:0 "Zerstörer 1944"
 RKS_destroyer_4_desc:0 "Although the first prototype of a diesel powered destroyer (Zerstörer 1942) was not completed, the development of the ship type continued. Several proposals were made which finally lead to the Zerstörer 1944 project. In addition to a heavy main armament, the ships had an increased Flak armament compared to its predecessors, including the new 5,5 cm AA gun."
 RKS_light_cruiser_1:0 "Emden Class"
 RKS_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "Emden was the first large warship built in Germany after World War I. She was laid down in 1921 and commissioned in 1925. The armament consisted of eight 150mm (5.9'') guns in single turrets."
 #RKS_light_cruiser_1b: "Königsberg Class"

 RKS_light_cruiser_3:0 "M Class"
 RKS_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The M-class cruisers were designed as scouts for commerce raiding squadrons. Six ships were ordered as part of Plan Z, with two being laid down before work was halted at the outbreak of the war. The main armament would have been eight 150mm guns in four twin turrets."
 RKS_light_cruiser_4:0 "Q Class"
 RKS_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Q-class cruisers were a modified M-class design. They were designed to be larger than the M-class with a heavier anti-aircraft armament and improved fire control."
 RKS_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Blücher Class"
 RKS_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "Blücher was the last armored cruiser built by Germany. Her design was innovative for her time and paved the way for the later Von der Tann-class Battlecruisers. By World War I, she was already obsolete. Blücher was sunk at the Battle at the Doggerbank in 1915."
 RKS_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Hipper Class"
 RKS_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Admiral Hipper Class heavy cruisers were the first heavy cruisers of the Kriegsmarine. Officially displacing 10,000 tons, in reality they displaced over 16000 tons. They were armed with eight 8'' guns in four twin turrets, with a secondary battery of twelve 105mm guns."
 RKS_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Prinz Eugen Class"
 RKS_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "Officially part of the Hipper Class, the Prinz Eugen subclass incorporates many improvements, including a heavier anti air armament. Of the three ships in the subclass, only Prinz Eugen was completed. She participated in the sinking of HMS Hood during Operation Rheinübung. After the war, she was transferred to the United States and served as USS Prinz Eugen in the Able and Baker atomic bomb tests before sinking at the Kwajalein Atoll in 1946."
 RKS_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "P Class Cruiser"
 RKS_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The P Class was a large heavy cruiser design, officially designated as Panzerschiff (Armored Ship) by the Kriegsmarine. Displacing almost 24,000 tons, they would have been 3,000 tons lighter but 55 meters longer than the U.S. New York-class battleships. The armament consisted of six 280mm guns in two triple turrets."
 RKS_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Yorck Class"
 RKS_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The three ships of the Yorck-class battlecruisers were designed in response to the British Renown Class. They would have been armed with eight 380mm guns in four twin turrets. All three ships were laid down in 1916, but none were completed due to the war."
 RKS_battle_cruiser_2:0 "O Class"
 RKS_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "In 1939, the Kriegsmarine decided to replace three of the planned P-class cruisers with battlecruisers. This resulted in the O-class battlecruisers, armed with six 38cm (15'') guns in three twin turrets. The ships were designed with a displacement of 35,400 tons and a top speed of 35 knots. Construction orders were given for the three ships of the class, but none were started."
 RKS_battleship_1:0 "Deutschland Class"
 RKS_battleship_1_desc:0 "Following the Treaty of Versailles, Germany was allowed to retain six pre-dreadnought battleships. Classified as Linienschiffe (Ships of the Line) by the Kriegsmarine, only two ships of the Deutschland Class, not to be confused with the later Deutschland-class Pocket Battleships, remained in active service through the 1930s. At 04:47 on September 1, 1939, Schleswig-Holstein fired the first shots of World War II as she opened fire on the Westerplatte base in Danzig, Poland."
 RKS_battleship_2:0 "Scharnhorst Class"
 RKS_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Scharnhorst-class battleships were the first modern battleships to be built for the Kriegsmarine. They were built as a response to the French Dunkerque-class battlecruisers, themselves a response to the German Deutschland-class Panzerschiffe (Pocket Battleships). The Scharnhorst class is armed with nine 283mm (11") guns in three triple turrets. Plans were made to up gun them with twin 380mm (15") guns, but with the outbreak of the war, this never happened."
 RKS_battleship_3:0 "Bismarck Class"
 RKS_battleship_3_desc:0 "The two-ship Bismarck-class battleships were the largest warships built for the Kriegsmarine. The ships were designed in response to the new French battleships under construction, with a similar armament of eight 38cm (15'') guns as the Richelieu Class, with four twin turrets as opposed to the two quad turrets of the Richelieus. Bismarck is famous for the sinking of the British battlecruiser HMS Hood in the Battle of the Denmark Strait, but was subsequently hunted down and sunk before reaching port."
 RKS_battleship_4:0 "Hindenburg Class"
 RKS_battleship_4_desc:0 "The German Plan Z envisioned a force of ten battleships in order to challenge the naval power of the United Kingdom. The H-class was a series of designs for the six battleships needed to meet the demands of the plan. Two ships of the H39 design were laid down at the outbreak of World War II, but construction was halted as the war begun. Neither of the ships were officially named, but Hindenburg was speculated as a possible name for the lead ship of the class. Had the ships been completed, they would have been augmented Bismarck Class ships, with a main battery of eight 40.6cm (16'') guns."
 RKS_carrier_1:0 "Flugzeugdampfer I"
 RKS_carrier_1_desc:0 "Designed in 1915, the Flugzeugdampfer I (Airplane Steamer I) Project was a conversion of the incomplete passenger liner Ausonia into an aircraft carrier. The construction was abandoned at the end of World War I. Had she been completed, she would have carried a mix of seaplanes and wheeled aircraft in her three hangars and would have displaced 12,500 tons."
 RKS_carrier_2:0 "Seydlitz Class"
 RKS_carrier_2_desc:0 "Seydlitz was laid down as the fourth ship of the Admiral Hipper-class heavy cruisers. Partially completed by the beginning of the war, she was considered for conversion into an aircraft carrier. The project, codenamed Weser 1, was partially underway when work was halted due to increasing air attacks on Bremen and the lack of resources for her construction."
 RKS_carrier_3:0 "Graf Zeppelin Class"
 RKS_carrier_3_desc:0 "Graf Zeppelin was the only class of ships in the Kriegsmarine that had been designed as an aircraft carrier from the keel up. Two ships were ordered, but neither was completed. As designed, the Graf Zeppelin would carry 30 Bf-109T fighters and 12 Ju-87E dive bombers, ship versions of the Bf-109E and the Ju-87D."
 RKS_carrier_4:0 "Europa Class"
 RKS_carrier_4_desc:0 "Several civilian ships were considered for conversions to aircraft carriers by the Kriegsmarine in the 1940s. The largest of these ships was the passenger ship Europa. Being the largest passenger ship in Germany, she had been used as a barracks ship and a troop transport before work began on converting her to a carrier. Had she been completed, she would have displaced 56,000 tons and carried an air group of 42 aircraft."
 RKS_SH_battleship_1:0 "Schlachtschiff H41"
 RKS_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The H41 design of battleships was an improvement over the previous H39 design. The design called for significantly stronger armor, strengthened torpedo bulkheads and protection for the ships rudder and propeller shafts. The main battery was upgraded to eight 42cm guns, larger than that of the proposed Lion Class battleships of the United Kingdom. As designed, these ships would have a displacement of almost 70,000 tons."
 RKS_SH_battleship_2:0 "Schlachtschiff H44"
 RKS_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The H44 Class was the last of the H-series of Battleship designs. With no limit on gun caliber or displacement, the H42 to H44 designs mounted increasingly heavier armament and armor protection, culminating in the 131,000 ton H44 design armed with eight 508mm (20'') guns."

 RKT_medium_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "As early as 1934/35, General Heinz Guderian envisioned two basic types to act as the most numerous equipment for the future German Panzer Divisions. The first vehicle was to be armed with anti-tank gun and two machine guns and the second one was to be a support vehicle armed with a larger caliber gun. The first one eventually became known as Panzerkampfwagen III, which was to be a standard tank for the three light companies of a tank battalion. The second one became known as Panzerkampfwagen IV."

 RKT_medium_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "Designed as an infantry-support tank, the Panzer IV was not originally intended to engage enemy armor - that function was performed by the lighter Panzer III. However, with the flaws of pre-war doctrine becoming apparent and in the face of Soviet T-34 tanks, the Panzer IV soon assumed the tank-fighting role of its increasingly obsolete cousin. The most widely manufactured and deployed German tank of the Second World War, the Panzer IV was used as the base for many other fighting vehicles."

It was intended as a counter to the Russian T-34, and as a replacement for the Panzer III and Panzer IV. While never replacing the latter, it served alongside it and the heavier Tiger tanks until the end of the war. The Panther's excellent combination of firepower, mobility, and protection served as a benchmark for other nations' late war and post-war tank designs, and it is regarded as one of the best tanks of World War II."

It entered service late in the war (1944) and saw service on the Eastern and Western fronts. The Jagdpanther combined the very powerful 8.8 cm PaK 43 cannon of the Tiger II and the characteristically excellent armor and suspension of the Panther chassis, although it suffered from the general poor state of Germany in the later part of the war, which resulted in small production numbers, shortage in spare parts and poor crew training."

 RKT_battleship_1_desc:0 "Following the Treaty of Versailles, Germany was allowed to retain six pre-dreadnought battleships. Classified as Linienschiffe (Ships of the Line) by the Kriegsmarine, only two ships of the Deutschland Class, not to be confused with the later Deutschland-class Pocket Battleships, remained in active service through the 1930s. At 04:47 on September 1, 1939, Schleswig-Holstein fired the first shots of World War II as she opened fire on the Westerplatte base in Danzig, Poland."
 RKT_battleship_2:0 "Scharnhorst Class"
 RKT_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Scharnhorst-class battleships were the first modern battleships to be built for the Kriegsmarine. They were built as a response to the French Dunkerque-class battlecruisers, themselves a response to the German Deutschland-class Panzerschiffe (Pocket Battleships). The Scharnhorst class is armed with nine 283mm (11") guns in three triple turrets. Plans were made to up gun them with twin 380mm (15") guns, but with the outbreak of the war, this never happened."
 RKT_battleship_3:0 "Bismarck Class"
 RKT_battleship_3_desc:0 "The two-ship Bismarck-class battleships were the largest warships built for the Kriegsmarine. The ships were designed in response to the new French battleships under construction, with a similar armament of eight 38cm (15'') guns as the Richelieu Class, with four twin turrets as opposed to the two quad turrets of the Richelieus. Bismarck is famous for the sinking of the British battlecruiser HMS Hood in the Battle of the Denmark Strait, but was subsequently hunted down and sunk before reaching port."
 RKT_battleship_4:0 "Hindenburg Class"
 RKT_battleship_4_desc:0 "The German Plan Z envisioned a force of ten battleships in order to challenge the naval power of the United Kingdom. The H-class was a series of designs for the six battleships needed to meet the demands of the plan. Two ships of the H39 design were laid down at the outbreak of World War II, but construction was halted as the war begun. Neither of the ships were officially named, but Hindenburg was speculated as a possible name for the lead ship of the class. Had the ships been completed, they would have been augmented Bismarck Class ships, with a main battery of eight 40.6cm (16'') guns."
 RKT_carrier_1:0 "Flugzeugdampfer I"
 RKT_carrier_1_desc:0 "Designed in 1915, the Flugzeugdampfer I (Airplane Steamer I) Project was a conversion of the incomplete passenger liner Ausonia into an aircraft carrier. The construction was abandoned at the end of World War I. Had she been completed, she would have carried a mix of seaplanes and wheeled aircraft in her three hangars and would have displaced 12,500 tons."
 RKT_carrier_2:0 "Seydlitz Class"
 RKT_carrier_2_desc:0 "Seydlitz was laid down as the fourth ship of the Admiral Hipper-class heavy cruisers. Partially completed by the beginning of the war, she was considered for conversion into an aircraft carrier. The project, codenamed Weser 1, was partially underway when work was halted due to increasing air attacks on Bremen and the lack of resources for her construction."
 RKT_carrier_3:0 "Graf Zeppelin Class"
 RKT_carrier_3_desc:0 "Graf Zeppelin was the only class of ships in the Kriegsmarine that had been designed as an aircraft carrier from the keel up. Two ships were ordered, but neither was completed. As designed, the Graf Zeppelin would carry 30 Bf-109T fighters and 12 Ju-87E dive bombers, ship versions of the Bf-109E and the Ju-87D."
 RKT_carrier_4:0 "Europa Class"
 RKT_carrier_4_desc:0 "Several civilian ships were considered for conversions to aircraft carriers by the Kriegsmarine in the 1940s. The largest of these ships was the passenger ship Europa. Being the largest passenger ship in Germany, she had been used as a barracks ship and a troop transport before work began on converting her to a carrier. Had she been completed, she would have displaced 56,000 tons and carried an air group of 42 aircraft."
 RKT_SH_battleship_1:0 "Schlachtschiff H41"
 RKT_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The H41 design of battleships was an improvement over the previous H39 design. The design called for significantly stronger armor, strengthened torpedo bulkheads and protection for the ships rudder and propeller shafts. The main battery was upgraded to eight 42cm guns, larger than that of the proposed Lion Class battleships of the United Kingdom. As designed, these ships would have a displacement of almost 70,000 tons."
 RKT_SH_battleship_2:0 "Schlachtschiff H44"
 RKT_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The H44 Class was the last of the H-series of Battleship designs. With no limit on gun caliber or displacement, the H42 to H44 designs mounted increasingly heavier armament and armor protection, culminating in the 131,000 ton H44 design armed with eight 508mm (20'') guns."

 RKU_submarine_2:0 "Type IIA"
 RKU_submarine_2_desc:0 "The German Type IIA submarine was a single hull, all welded coastal submarine with internal ballast tanks. It displaced over 250 tons and mounts five 533mm torpedo tubes. Six were built between 1934 and 1935."
 #RKU_submarine_2b: "Type VIIA"
 RKU_submarine_3:0 "Type VIIC"
 RKU_submarine_3_desc:0 "The Type VIIC seagoing submarine was the workhorse of the German U-boat force, with 568 commissioned between 1940 and 1945. The ships displaced 770 tons and were armed with five 533mm torpedo tubes."
 #RKU_submarine_3b: "Type IXC"
 RKU_submarine_4:0 "Type XXI"
 RKU_submarine_4_desc:0 "Type XXI submarines, also known as 'Elektroboote', were the first submarines designed to operate primarily submerged, rather than as surface ships that could submerge as a means to escape detection or launch an attack. Its key features were its streamlined hull and conning tower and its large number of battery cells. It was among the largest of the German submarine classes, displacing over 1,620 tons. There were 118 ships commissioned between 1943 and 1945."
 RKU_destroyer_1:0 "Type 23"
 RKU_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The Type 23 was a class of torpedo boat built for the Kriegsmarine following World War I. Six vessels were built between 1926 and 1928 and all served during World War II. Despite their torpedo boat designation, the ships were destroyer-sized, displacing over 920 tons and armed with three 105mm L/45 guns."
 RKU_destroyer_2:0 "Zerstörer 1934"
 RKU_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The Zerstörer 1934 class was the first class of German destroyers built since World War I. They were armed with five 5'' guns and eight torpedo tubes. 16 ships were built, out of which 12 were the improved Zerstörer 1934A subclass."
 RKU_destroyer_3:0 "Narvik Class"
 RKU_destroyer_3_desc:0 "Zerstörer 1936A, known to the allies as Narvik Class destroyers, was designed to carry the new 150mm (5.9'') guns. Designed with three single guns aft and a twin gun in the bow, they were originally fitted with a single gun in the bow. Four of the eight ships of the class were later refitted with the twin turrets. A second group of seven destroyers were built to a slightly modified design with twin guns in the bow."
 RKU_destroyer_4:0 "Zerstörer 1944"
 RKU_destroyer_4_desc:0 "Although the first prototype of a diesel powered destroyer (Zerstörer 1942) was not completed, the development of the ship type continued. Several proposals were made which finally lead to the Zerstörer 1944 project. In addition to a heavy main armament, the ships had an increased Flak armament compared to its predecessors, including the new 5,5 cm AA gun."
 RKU_light_cruiser_1:0 "Emden Class"
 RKU_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "Emden was the first large warship built in Germany after World War I. She was laid down in 1921 and commissioned in 1925. The armament consisted of eight 150mm (5.9'') guns in single turrets."
 #RKU_light_cruiser_1b: "Königsberg Class"
 RKU_light_cruiser_2:1 "Leipzig Class"
 RKU_light_cruiser_2_desc:1 "The Leipzig-class light cruisers were built between 1928 and 1935 as improvements over the preceding Königsberg-class cruisers. They displaced over 8,100 tons, had adequate speed and range, and were armed with nine 15cm SK C/25 guns in their main armament."
 RKU_light_cruiser_3:0 "M Class"
 RKU_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The M-class cruisers were designed as scouts for commerce raiding squadrons. Six ships were ordered as part of Plan Z, with two being laid down before work was halted at the outbreak of the war. The main armament would have been eight 150mm guns in four twin turrets."
 RKU_light_cruiser_4:0 "Q Class"
 RKU_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Q-class cruisers were a modified M-class design. They were designed to be larger than the M-class with a heavier anti-aircraft armament and improved fire control."
 RKU_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Blücher Class"
 RKU_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "Blücher was the last armored cruiser built by Germany. Her design was innovative for her time and paved the way for the later Von der Tann-class Battlecruisers. By World War I, she was already obsolete. Blücher was sunk at the Battle at the Doggerbank in 1915."
 RKU_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Hipper Class"
 RKU_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Admiral Hipper Class heavy cruisers were the first heavy cruisers of the Kriegsmarine. Officially displacing 10,000 tons, in reality they displaced over 16000 tons. They were armed with eight 8'' guns in four twin turrets, with a secondary battery of twelve 105mm guns."
 RKU_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Prinz Eugen Class"
 RKU_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "Officially part of the Hipper Class, the Prinz Eugen subclass incorporates many improvements, including a heavier anti air armament. Of the three ships in the subclass, only Prinz Eugen was completed. She participated in the sinking of HMS Hood during Operation Rheinübung. After the war, she was transferred to the United States and served as USS Prinz Eugen in the Able and Baker atomic bomb tests before sinking at the Kwajalein Atoll in 1946."
 RKU_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "P Class Cruiser"
 RKU_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The P Class was a large heavy cruiser design, officially designated as Panzerschiff (Armored Ship) by the Kriegsmarine. Displacing almost 24,000 tons, they would have been 3,000 tons lighter but 55 meters longer than the U.S. New York-class battleships. The armament consisted of six 280mm guns in two triple turrets."
 RKU_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Yorck Class"
 RKU_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The three ships of the Yorck-class battlecruisers were designed in response to the British Renown Class. They would have been armed with eight 380mm guns in four twin turrets. All three ships were laid down in 1916, but none were completed due to the war."
 RKU_battle_cruiser_2:0 "O Class"
 RKU_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "In 1939, the Kriegsmarine decided to replace three of the planned P-class cruisers with battlecruisers. This resulted in the O-class battlecruisers, armed with six 38cm (15'') guns in three twin turrets. The ships were designed with a displacement of 35,400 tons and a top speed of 35 knots. Construction orders were given for the three ships of the class, but none were started."
 RKU_battleship_1:0 "Deutschland Class"
 RKU_battleship_1_desc:0 "Following the Treaty of Versailles, Germany was allowed to retain six pre-dreadnought battleships. Classified as Linienschiffe (Ships of the Line) by the Kriegsmarine, only two ships of the Deutschland Class, not to be confused with the later Deutschland-class Pocket Battleships, remained in active service through the 1930s. At 04:47 on September 1, 1939, Schleswig-Holstein fired the first shots of World War II as she opened fire on the Westerplatte base in Danzig, Poland."
 RKU_battleship_2:0 "Scharnhorst Class"
 RKU_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Scharnhorst-class battleships were the first modern battleships to be built for the Kriegsmarine. They were built as a response to the French Dunkerque-class battlecruisers, themselves a response to the German Deutschland-class Panzerschiffe (Pocket Battleships). The Scharnhorst class is armed with nine 283mm (11") guns in three triple turrets. Plans were made to up gun them with twin 380mm (15") guns, but with the outbreak of the war, this never happened."
 RKU_battleship_3:0 "Bismarck Class"
 RKU_battleship_3_desc:0 "The two-ship Bismarck-class battleships were the largest warships built for the Kriegsmarine. The ships were designed in response to the new French battleships under construction, with a similar armament of eight 38cm (15'') guns as the Richelieu Class, with four twin turrets as opposed to the two quad turrets of the Richelieus. Bismarck is famous for the sinking of the British battlecruiser HMS Hood in the Battle of the Denmark Strait, but was subsequently hunted down and sunk before reaching port."
 RKU_battleship_4:0 "Hindenburg Class"
 RKU_battleship_4_desc:0 "The German Plan Z envisioned a force of ten battleships in order to challenge the naval power of the United Kingdom. The H-class was a series of designs for the six battleships needed to meet the demands of the plan. Two ships of the H39 design were laid down at the outbreak of World War II, but construction was halted as the war begun. Neither of the ships were officially named, but Hindenburg was speculated as a possible name for the lead ship of the class. Had the ships been completed, they would have been augmented Bismarck Class ships, with a main battery of eight 40.6cm (16'') guns."
 RKU_carrier_1:0 "Flugzeugdampfer I"
 RKU_carrier_1_desc:0 "Designed in 1915, the Flugzeugdampfer I (Airplane Steamer I) Project was a conversion of the incomplete passenger liner Ausonia into an aircraft carrier. The construction was abandoned at the end of World War I. Had she been completed, she would have carried a mix of seaplanes and wheeled aircraft in her three hangars and would have displaced 12,500 tons."
 RKU_carrier_2:0 "Seydlitz Class"
 RKU_carrier_2_desc:0 "Seydlitz was laid down as the fourth ship of the Admiral Hipper-class heavy cruisers. Partially completed by the beginning of the war, she was considered for conversion into an aircraft carrier. The project, codenamed Weser 1, was partially underway when work was halted due to increasing air attacks on Bremen and the lack of resources for her construction."
 RKU_carrier_3:0 "Graf Zeppelin Class"
 RKU_carrier_3_desc:0 "Graf Zeppelin was the only class of ships in the Kriegsmarine that had been designed as an aircraft carrier from the keel up. Two ships were ordered, but neither was completed. As designed, the Graf Zeppelin would carry 30 Bf-109T fighters and 12 Ju-87E dive bombers, ship versions of the Bf-109E and the Ju-87D."
 RKU_carrier_4:0 "Europa Class"
 RKU_carrier_4_desc:0 "Several civilian ships were considered for conversions to aircraft carriers by the Kriegsmarine in the 1940s. The largest of these ships was the passenger ship Europa. Being the largest passenger ship in Germany, she had been used as a barracks ship and a troop transport before work began on converting her to a carrier. Had she been completed, she would have displaced 56,000 tons and carried an air group of 42 aircraft."
 RKU_SH_battleship_1:0 "Schlachtschiff H41"
 RKU_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The H41 design of battleships was an improvement over the previous H39 design. The design called for significantly stronger armor, strengthened torpedo bulkheads and protection for the ships rudder and propeller shafts. The main battery was upgraded to eight 42cm guns, larger than that of the proposed Lion Class battleships of the United Kingdom. As designed, these ships would have a displacement of almost 70,000 tons."
 RKU_SH_battleship_2:0 "Schlachtschiff H44"
 RKU_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The H44 Class was the last of the H-series of Battleship designs. With no limit on gun caliber or displacement, the H42 to H44 designs mounted increasingly heavier armament and armor protection, culminating in the 131,000 ton H44 design armed with eight 508mm (20'') guns."

The first vehicle was to be armed with anti-tank gun and two machine guns and the second one was to be a support vehicle armed with a larger caliber gun. The first one eventually became known as Panzerkampfwagen III, which was to be a standard tank for the three light companies of a tank battalion.

However, with the flaws of pre-war doctrine becoming apparent and in the face of Soviet T-34 tanks, the Panzer IV soon assumed the tank-fighting role of its increasingly obsolete cousin. The most widely manufactured and deployed German tank of the Second World War, the Panzer IV was used as the base for many other fighting vehicles."

It was intended as a counter to the Russian T-34, and as a replacement for the Panzer III and Panzer IV. While never replacing the latter, it served alongside it and the heavier Tiger tanks until the end of the war. The Panther's excellent combination of firepower, mobility, and protection served as a benchmark for other nations' late war and post-war tank designs, and it is regarded as one of the best tanks of World War II."

Classified as Linienschiffe (Ships of the Line) by the Kriegsmarine, only two ships of the Deutschland Class, not to be confused with the later Deutschland-class Pocket Battleships, remained in active service through the 1930s. At 04:47 on September 1, 1939, Schleswig-Holstein fired the first shots of World War II as she opened fire on the Westerplatte base in Danzig, Poland."
 RKV_battleship_2:0 "Scharnhorst Class"
 RKV_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Scharnhorst-class battleships were the first modern battleships to be built for the Kriegsmarine. They were built as a response to the French Dunkerque-class battlecruisers, themselves a response to the German Deutschland-class Panzerschiffe (Pocket Battleships). The Scharnhorst class is armed with nine 283mm (11") guns in three triple turrets. Plans were made to up gun them with twin 380mm (15") guns, but with the outbreak of the war, this never happened."
 RKV_battleship_3:0 "Bismarck Class"
 RKV_battleship_3_desc:0 "The two-ship Bismarck-class battleships were the largest warships built for the Kriegsmarine. The ships were designed in response to the new French battleships under construction, with a similar armament of eight 38cm (15'') guns as the Richelieu Class, with four twin turrets as opposed to the two quad turrets of the Richelieus. Bismarck is famous for the sinking of the British battlecruiser HMS Hood in the Battle of the Denmark Strait, but was subsequently hunted down and sunk before reaching port."
 RKV_battleship_4:0 "Hindenburg Class"
 RKV_battleship_4_desc:0 "The German Plan Z envisioned a force of ten battleships in order to challenge the naval power of the United Kingdom. The H-class was a series of designs for the six battleships needed to meet the demands of the plan. Two ships of the H39 design were laid down at the outbreak of World War II, but construction was halted as the war begun. Neither of the ships were officially named, but Hindenburg was speculated as a possible name for the lead ship of the class. Had the ships been completed, they would have been augmented Bismarck Class ships, with a main battery of eight 40.6cm (16'') guns."
 RKV_carrier_1:0 "Flugzeugdampfer I"
 RKV_carrier_1_desc:0 "Designed in 1915, the Flugzeugdampfer I (Airplane Steamer I) Project was a conversion of the incomplete passenger liner Ausonia into an aircraft carrier. The construction was abandoned at the end of World War I. Had she been completed, she would have carried a mix of seaplanes and wheeled aircraft in her three hangars and would have displaced 12,500 tons."
 RKV_carrier_2:0 "Seydlitz Class"
 RKV_carrier_2_desc:0 "Seydlitz was laid down as the fourth ship of the Admiral Hipper-class heavy cruisers. Partially completed by the beginning of the war, she was considered for conversion into an aircraft carrier. The project, codenamed Weser 1, was partially underway when work was halted due to increasing air attacks on Bremen and the lack of resources for her construction."
 RKV_carrier_3:0 "Graf Zeppelin Class"
 RKV_carrier_3_desc:0 "Graf Zeppelin was the only class of ships in the Kriegsmarine that had been designed as an aircraft carrier from the keel up. Two ships were ordered, but neither was completed. As designed, the Graf Zeppelin would carry 30 Bf-109T fighters and 12 Ju-87E dive bombers, ship versions of the Bf-109E and the Ju-87D."
 RKV_carrier_4:0 "Europa Class"
 RKV_carrier_4_desc:0 "Several civilian ships were considered for conversions to aircraft carriers by the Kriegsmarine in the 1940s. The largest of these ships was the passenger ship Europa. Being the largest passenger ship in Germany, she had been used as a barracks ship and a troop transport before work began on converting her to a carrier. Had she been completed, she would have displaced 56,000 tons and carried an air group of 42 aircraft."
 RKV_SH_battleship_1:0 "Schlachtschiff H41"
 RKV_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The H41 design of battleships was an improvement over the previous H39 design. The design called for significantly stronger armor, strengthened torpedo bulkheads and protection for the ships rudder and propeller shafts. The main battery was upgraded to eight 42cm guns, larger than that of the proposed Lion Class battleships of the United Kingdom. As designed, these ships would have a displacement of almost 70,000 tons."
 RKV_SH_battleship_2:0 "Schlachtschiff H44"
 RKV_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The H44 Class was the last of the H-series of Battleship designs. With no limit on gun caliber or displacement, the H42 to H44 designs mounted increasingly heavier armament and armor protection, culminating in the 131,000 ton H44 design armed with eight 508mm (20'') guns."

 RKW_medium_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "As early as 1934/35, General Heinz Guderian envisioned two basic types to act as the most numerous equipment for the future German Panzer Divisions. The first vehicle was to be armed with anti-tank gun and two machine guns and the second one was to be a support vehicle armed with a larger caliber gun. The first one eventually became known as Panzerkampfwagen III, which was to be a standard tank for the three light companies of a tank battalion.

While never replacing the latter, it served alongside it and the heavier Tiger tanks until the end of the war. The Panther's excellent combination of firepower, mobility, and protection served as a benchmark for other nations' late war and post-war tank designs, and it is regarded as one of the best tanks of World War II."

 RKW_submarine_2:0 "Type IIA"
 RKW_submarine_2_desc:0 "The German Type IIA submarine was a single hull, all welded coastal submarine with internal ballast tanks. It displaced over 250 tons and mounts five 533mm torpedo tubes. Six were built between 1934 and 1935."
 #RKW_submarine_2b: "Type VIIA"
 RKW_submarine_3:0 "Type VIIC"
 RKW_submarine_3_desc:0 "The Type VIIC seagoing submarine was the workhorse of the German U-boat force, with 568 commissioned between 1940 and 1945. The ships displaced 770 tons and were armed with five 533mm torpedo tubes."
 #RKW_submarine_3b: "Type IXC"
 RKW_submarine_4:0 "Type XXI"
 RKW_submarine_4_desc:0 "Type XXI submarines, also known as 'Elektroboote', were the first submarines designed to operate primarily submerged, rather than as surface ships that could submerge as a means to escape detection or launch an attack. Its key features were its streamlined hull and conning tower and its large number of battery cells. It was among the largest of the German submarine classes, displacing over 1,620 tons. There were 118 ships commissioned between 1943 and 1945."
 RKW_destroyer_1:0 "Type 23"
 RKW_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The Type 23 was a class of torpedo boat built for the Kriegsmarine following World War I. Six vessels were built between 1926 and 1928 and all served during World War II. Despite their torpedo boat designation, the ships were destroyer-sized, displacing over 920 tons and armed with three 105mm L/45 guns."
 RKW_destroyer_2:0 "Zerstörer 1934"
 RKW_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The Zerstörer 1934 class was the first class of German destroyers built since World War I. They were armed with five 5'' guns and eight torpedo tubes. 16 ships were built, out of which 12 were the improved Zerstörer 1934A subclass."
 RKW_destroyer_3:0 "Narvik Class"
 RKW_destroyer_3_desc:0 "Zerstörer 1936A, known to the allies as Narvik Class destroyers, was designed to carry the new 150mm (5.9'') guns. Designed with three single guns aft and a twin gun in the bow, they were originally fitted with a single gun in the bow. Four of the eight ships of the class were later refitted with the twin turrets. A second group of seven destroyers were built to a slightly modified design with twin guns in the bow."
 RKW_destroyer_4:0 "Zerstörer 1944"
 RKW_destroyer_4_desc:0 "Although the first prototype of a diesel powered destroyer (Zerstörer 1942) was not completed, the development of the ship type continued. Several proposals were made which finally lead to the Zerstörer 1944 project. In addition to a heavy main armament, the ships had an increased Flak armament compared to its predecessors, including the new 5,5 cm AA gun."
 RKW_light_cruiser_1:0 "Emden Class"
 RKW_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "Emden was the first large warship built in Germany after World War I. She was laid down in 1921 and commissioned in 1925. The armament consisted of eight 150mm (5.9'') guns in single turrets."
 #RKW_light_cruiser_1b: "Königsberg Class"
 RKW_light_cruiser_2:1 "Leipzig Class"
 RKW_light_cruiser_2_desc:1 "The Leipzig-class light cruisers were built between 1928 and 1935 as improvements over the preceding Königsberg-class cruisers. They displaced over 8,100 tons, had adequate speed and range, and were armed with nine 15cm SK C/25 guns in their main armament."
 RKW_light_cruiser_3:0 "M Class"
 RKW_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The M-class cruisers were designed as scouts for commerce raiding squadrons. Six ships were ordered as part of Plan Z, with two being laid down before work was halted at the outbreak of the war. The main armament would have been eight 150mm guns in four twin turrets."
 RKW_light_cruiser_4:0 "Q Class"
 RKW_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Q-class cruisers were a modified M-class design. They were designed to be larger than the M-class with a heavier anti-aircraft armament and improved fire control."
 RKW_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Blücher Class"
 RKW_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "Blücher was the last armored cruiser built by Germany. Her design was innovative for her time and paved the way for the later Von der Tann-class Battlecruisers. By World War I, she was already obsolete. Blücher was sunk at the Battle at the Doggerbank in 1915."
 RKW_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Hipper Class"
 RKW_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Admiral Hipper Class heavy cruisers were the first heavy cruisers of the Kriegsmarine. Officially displacing 10,000 tons, in reality they displaced over 16000 tons.

 RKW_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Prinz Eugen Class"
 RKW_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "Officially part of the Hipper Class, the Prinz Eugen subclass incorporates many improvements, including a heavier anti air armament. Of the three ships in the subclass, only Prinz Eugen was completed. She participated in the sinking of HMS Hood during Operation Rheinübung. After the war, she was transferred to the United States and served as USS Prinz Eugen in the Able and Baker atomic bomb tests before sinking at the Kwajalein Atoll in 1946."
 RKW_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "P Class Cruiser"
 RKW_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The P Class was a large heavy cruiser design, officially designated as Panzerschiff (Armored Ship) by the Kriegsmarine. Displacing almost 24,000 tons, they would have been 3,000 tons lighter but 55 meters longer than the U.S. New York-class battleships. The armament consisted of six 280mm guns in two triple turrets."
 RKW_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Yorck Class"
 RKW_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The three ships of the Yorck-class battlecruisers were designed in response to the British Renown Class. They would have been armed with eight 380mm guns in four twin turrets. All three ships were laid down in 1916, but none were completed due to the war."
 RKW_battle_cruiser_2:0 "O Class"
 RKW_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "In 1939, the Kriegsmarine decided to replace three of the planned P-class cruisers with battlecruisers. This resulted in the O-class battlecruisers, armed with six 38cm (15'') guns in three twin turrets. The ships were designed with a displacement of 35,400 tons and a top speed of 35 knots. Construction orders were given for the three ships of the class, but none were started."
 RKW_battleship_1:0 "Deutschland Class"
 RKW_battleship_1_desc:0 "Following the Treaty of Versailles, Germany was allowed to retain six pre-dreadnought battleships. Classified as Linienschiffe (Ships of the Line) by the Kriegsmarine, only two ships of the Deutschland Class, not to be confused with the later Deutschland-class Pocket Battleships, remained in active service through the 1930s. At 04:47 on September 1, 1939, Schleswig-Holstein fired the first shots of World War II as she opened fire on the Westerplatte base in Danzig, Poland."
 RKW_battleship_2:0 "Scharnhorst Class"
 RKW_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Scharnhorst-class battleships were the first modern battleships to be built for the Kriegsmarine. They were built as a response to the French Dunkerque-class battlecruisers, themselves a response to the German Deutschland-class Panzerschiffe (Pocket Battleships). The Scharnhorst class is armed with nine 283mm (11") guns in three triple turrets. Plans were made to up gun them with twin 380mm (15") guns, but with the outbreak of the war, this never happened."
 RKW_battleship_3:0 "Bismarck Class"
 RKW_battleship_3_desc:0 "The two-ship Bismarck-class battleships were the largest warships built for the Kriegsmarine. The ships were designed in response to the new French battleships under construction, with a similar armament of eight 38cm (15'') guns as the Richelieu Class, with four twin turrets as opposed to the two quad turrets of the Richelieus. Bismarck is famous for the sinking of the British battlecruiser HMS Hood in the Battle of the Denmark Strait, but was subsequently hunted down and sunk before reaching port."
 RKW_battleship_4:0 "Hindenburg Class"
 RKW_battleship_4_desc:0 "The German Plan Z envisioned a force of ten battleships in order to challenge the naval power of the United Kingdom. The H-class was a series of designs for the six battleships needed to meet the demands of the plan. Two ships of the H39 design were laid down at the outbreak of World War II, but construction was halted as the war begun. Neither of the ships were officially named, but Hindenburg was speculated as a possible name for the lead ship of the class. Had the ships been completed, they would have been augmented Bismarck Class ships, with a main battery of eight 40.6cm (16'') guns."
 RKW_carrier_1:0 "Flugzeugdampfer I"
 RKW_carrier_1_desc:0 "Designed in 1915, the Flugzeugdampfer I (Airplane Steamer I) Project was a conversion of the incomplete passenger liner Ausonia into an aircraft carrier. The construction was abandoned at the end of World War I. Had she been completed, she would have carried a mix of seaplanes and wheeled aircraft in her three hangars and would have displaced 12,500 tons."
 RKW_carrier_2:0 "Seydlitz Class"
 RKW_carrier_2_desc:0 "Seydlitz was laid down as the fourth ship of the Admiral Hipper-class heavy cruisers. Partially completed by the beginning of the war, she was considered for conversion into an aircraft carrier. The project, codenamed Weser 1, was partially underway when work was halted due to increasing air attacks on Bremen and the lack of resources for her construction."
 RKW_carrier_3:0 "Graf Zeppelin Class"
 RKW_carrier_3_desc:0 "Graf Zeppelin was the only class of ships in the Kriegsmarine that had been designed as an aircraft carrier from the keel up. Two ships were ordered, but neither was completed. As designed, the Graf Zeppelin would carry 30 Bf-109T fighters and 12 Ju-87E dive bombers, ship versions of the Bf-109E and the Ju-87D."
 RKW_carrier_4:0 "Europa Class"
 RKW_carrier_4_desc:0 "Several civilian ships were considered for conversions to aircraft carriers by the Kriegsmarine in the 1940s. The largest of these ships was the passenger ship Europa. Being the largest passenger ship in Germany, she had been used as a barracks ship and a troop transport before work began on converting her to a carrier. Had she been completed, she would have displaced 56,000 tons and carried an air group of 42 aircraft."
 RKW_SH_battleship_1:0 "Schlachtschiff H41"
 RKW_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The H41 design of battleships was an improvement over the previous H39 design. The design called for significantly stronger armor, strengthened torpedo bulkheads and protection for the ships rudder and propeller shafts. The main battery was upgraded to eight 42cm guns, larger than that of the proposed Lion Class battleships of the United Kingdom. As designed, these ships would have a displacement of almost 70,000 tons."
 RKW_SH_battleship_2:0 "Schlachtschiff H44"
 RKW_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The H44 Class was the last of the H-series of Battleship designs. With no limit on gun caliber or displacement, the H42 to H44 designs mounted increasingly heavier armament and armor protection, culminating in the 131,000 ton H44 design armed with eight 508mm (20'') guns."

Historically, the defeat at Stalingrad in 1943 made realization of this goal impossible.Hitler's desire to get this territory was so great that on the eve of the summer offensive of 1942, his generals decided to give him a cake in the form of Baku and the Caspian sea. Of course, Hitler sliced out Baku for himself.\n \nThe acquisition of these oil fields has become a major strategic and economic asset resulting from the success of Operation Barbarossa. Although the equipment was severely damaged during the invasion and deliberate sabotage of the retreating Red Army forces. The fact that there is an ocean of oil under this land obliges us to provide special protection over this region.\n \nHitler has made it abundantly clear that this territory is to become an integral part of the Reich and any investment that can be made into the development, integration, and defense of this area must be pursued as a top priority.

Together with staunch Nazis Kurt Daluege and Walter Schellenberg, Heydrich organized the purging of Ernest Roehm's SA (Sturmabteilung). This massacre would later be known as the 'Night of the Long Knives'. In 1936 Heydrich became head of the SD and the Gestapo. When Himmler and the SS were put in charge of the concentration camps, Heydrich was assigned to Czechoslovakia where he intended to 'Germanize the Czech vermin'. Luckily the Czech resistance (with some help from the British MI6) put a stop to Heydrich's bloody reign. Heydrich was killed when an assassination squad tossed an anti-tank grenade in his car. One of Hitler's most evil henchmen was dead, but the German retaliation would be savage and brutal.

Gaeu Posen was created in September 1939 and as Reichsgau Posen annexed by Germany on 8 October 1939, with SS Obergruppenfuhrer Arthur Greiser as the only Gauleiter. The name Reichsgau Wartheland was introduced on 29 January 1940. It comprised the Greater Poland and adjacent areas, and only in part matched the area of the similarly named pre-Versailles Prussian province of Posen. The name was initially derived from the capital city, Posen (Poznan), and later from the main river, Warthe (Warta). The territory was inhabited by Poles and a German minority (16.7 percent of total population in 1921). In the Wartheland, the Nazis' goal was complete 'Germanization', or political, cultural, social, and economic assimilation of the territory into the German Reich. In pursuit of this goal, the installed bureaucracy renamed streets and cities and seized tens of thousands of Polish enterprises, from large industrial firms to small shops, without payment to the owners. \n \nAs early as October 1939, many Poles were expelled from the annexed lands to make room for German colonizers. Only those Poles selected for Germanization, approximately 1.7 million including thousands of children who had been taken from their parents, were permitted to remain, and if they resisted it, they were to be sent to concentration camps, because "German blood must not be utilized in the interest of a foreign nation". By the end of 1940, at least 325,000 Poles from annexed lands were forcibly resettled in the General Government, forced to abandon most of their property"

As a result of the cooperative attitude of the Danish authorities, German officials claimed that they would 'respect Danish sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as neutrality.'

Having maintained its neutrality since the end of Napoleonic Wars in 1815, it was only through a careful balance of diplomatic maneuvering and concessions to Germany that Sweden was able to maintain its sovereignty and avoid direct involvement in the conflict. During Operation Barbarossa, Sweden allowed the Wehrmacht railway transit for personnel and munitions into Finland. The country was also a vital trading partner that supplied critical iron ore to the Reich. As the war neared its conclusion in 1944 and 1945, they allowed the Allies to use Swedish air bases. Sweden also became an important destination for refugees fleeing the war, including Jewish and other persecuted populations.\n \nHitler's personal of view of the Swedish was generally positive, as he viewed the Scandinavian people to be of the purest Nordic descent. Sweden was not occupied during the war for a variety of reasons, not least of which was that occupation would have been costly and that the Swedes were generally compliant with the Reich's interests.

Historically, a Reichskommissariat division did not encompass all of Scandinavia, though the regime established in Norway serves as an example for this concept. Hitler vowed that he would never leave Norway, and even favored the annexation of Denmark at a later date. The Nordic people of Scandinavia were destined to become part of the Reich once Hitler's vision came to fruition.\n \nNow that we have brought all of Scandinavia under our control, we can create a new Reichsprotektorat to ensure that this area will become an integral part of the German nation. Its population will retain their native languages and customs for a time, while the next generation will be educated to identify solely with their Germanic racial character and no longer see themselves as part of disparate nationalities.

With the conclusion of hostilities in Norway this argument became untenable, forcing the Cabinet to give in to German pressure and allow continuous (unarmed) troop transports, via Swedish railroads, between Germany and Norway. The extent of these transports was kept secret, although spreading rumors soon forced prime minister Per Albin Hansson to admit their existence. Officially the trains transported wounded soldiers and soldiers on leave, which would still have been in violation of Sweden's proclaimed neutrality. In all, close to 100,000 railroad cars had transported 1,004,158 military personnel on leave to Germany and 1,037,158 to Norway through Sweden by the time the transit agreement was disbanded on 15 August 1943."

BP_germany.404.d:0 "The Republic of Turkey - a country that rose from the ashes of the Ottoman Empire after World War I and defended its independence in the war just a few decades ago, today is balancing on the knife blade between the Axis and the Allies. The destroyed economy and the new movement of Pan-Turkic Nationalism led the country into a difficult situation, as a result of which the Turkish government declared neutrality in the new conflict, which began to flare up in Europe.\n \nWhen German tanks were 50 miles from Istanbul during the incursions into Yugoslavia and Greece, the Turkish leadership destroyed key bridges in anticipation of further German aggression in the area. The Non-Aggression Pact, signed in 1941 just four days before the invasion of the Soviet Union, eased tensions between the factions involved, as the Axis, Allies and the Soviet Union closely monitored Turkey and the situation in the region.\n \nWith the success of operation "Barbarossa", Turkey can no longer take a neutral position. The Reich should have full control over the Black Sea for the transportation of crude oil from the oil fields of the Caucasus and the implementation of the plan Ost in the Crimea. The Middle East must be brought into our sphere of influence, and Turkey is on our way. Although Hitler was nominally respectful of the Turks as former allies in World War I, he understood that the head of the Republic of Turkey, Ismet Inon, could not be trusted. His refusal to cooperate more actively with the Axis in the past, along with his conciliatory attitude towards refugees leaving our occupied territories, can no longer be tolerated. Our forces are ready to create a New Order in the Middle East."

The British were well aware that Turkey is on the border of Europe and the Middle East and can be used as a way to strike at Syria, Iraq and the threat to India. Finally, the Soviet Union, with its historical Russian antagonism towards the Ottoman Empire, did not leave any of these problems unnoticed and knew that their possessions in the Caucasus could be threatened if Turkey sided with the Germans.\n \nDuring the war, Turkey came under our occupation. We must now decide the fate of the region. Anatolia is a complex region full of diverse national groups with different interests, many of which were under the centuries-old occupation of the Turks. We can balance these groups with our own interests in Anatolia, the ambitions of our allies and, of course, the future of the Turkish nation itself.

Part of the anti-British Iraqi military, grouped in the 1930s around German Ambassador Fritz Grobba, became known as the "Circle of Seven", and their leaders — as the "Golden Four". After the suppression of the anti-British uprising in Palestine, many of its participants found refuge in Iraq, here later moved and rebel leader, a former mufti of Jerusalem Amin al-Husseini.\n \nAs a result of this growth of anti-British sentiment was a coup in Iraq. On 1 April 1941, the regime of Regent Abd al-Ilah was overthrown, and Rashid Ali al-Gaylani was declared Prime Minister. The coup was led by four Iraqi generals, who were in the nationalist group 'Golden Square'. Since Iraq gained only formal independence in 1932, the aim of the group was to use the war to achieve full independence and the establishment of the pan-Arab state, which led to cooperation with German intelligence and the adoption of military assistance from Germany. The change of government led to the British invasion and subsequent occupation of Iraq, which lasted until 1947."

Despite the strong position of British capital, which played a key role in the Iranian economy, the geopolitical bias towards the Third Reich became stronger. In addition, since 1933 Berlin has taken relations with Iran to a new qualitative level. Reich begins to take an active part in the development of the economy, infrastructure of Iran, the reform of the armed forces of the monarchy. In the Third Reich, Iranian youth, the military, whom Goebbels propaganda called "Sons of Zaratushtra", are being trained. German ideologists declared the Persians "Pure Aryans" and they were exempted from the Nuremberg Racial Laws by a special decree. As a result, by the beginning of the Second World War, the Third Reich had gained a strong position in Iran, and in fact the country was turning into a German base in the Middle East region. By 1941, the situation with Iran and its "aryan bias" for Moscow and London was as follows: there was a real threat that Iran's oil and transport infrastructure built on British capital will be used by the Third Reich against the USSR and Britain. Thus, only one oil refinery in Abadan processed 8 million tons of oil in 1940. And aviation gasoline in the whole region was produced only in Baku and Abadan. In addition, if the German armed forces broke from North Africa to Palestine, Syria, or in 1942 reached the border of Baku – Derbent – Astrakhan, Turkey and Iran's entry into the war on the side of Germany would be a matter resolved. In connection with the planned offensive of the Wehrmacht deep into the Soviet Union, the Persian corridor, passing through the territory of the trans-Iranian railway, was one of the easiest ways to implement the lend-lease program implemented by the United States by sea. British and Soviet engineers recognized the great importance of this railway and sought to keep it under close attention. The increased number of attacks by German submarines and the ice covering of the sea in the area of Arkhangelsk have increased the danger of using this route, so that the need for the use of the railway has increased significantly. Moreover, the Soviet government sought to include Iran, Azerbaijan and Turkmensahra ("Turkmen plain") part of the state, and to bring to power in Iran, the Communists. The pressure of the UK and the USSR on Iran led to an increase in tension and a massive anti-British speech in Tehran, which, according to the British, were of a Pro-German nature. Iran's strategic position hampered the security of the Soviet oil-producing areas and the rear of the red Army and threatened British military routes between India and the Mediterranean."

With almost a year to prepare, produce, and stockpile for Barbarossa, the Germans had enough fundamental materials of war to win in the Soviet Union in 1941. The German logistical problem was how to transport material from adequate stockpiles to an army operating under difficult circumstances in a large country without normal-gauge railways and with unpaved roads. The Germans would center logistics on the construction of rail lines and station installations. They would also organize great truck forces to move materials from stockpiles on the frontier until the new rail lines could be completed and rail heads (i.e., train stations where supplies were stockpiled) could be established in the Soviet Union. The Germans organized great logistical truck forces behind each army group to pick up supplies from the frontier rail heads and deliver them into truck dumps as close as possible to the advancing field armies. The truck forces, broken down into flexible 60-ton-capacity columns of vehicles to move supplies, would operate back and forth from the frontier stockpiles until the new train stations and German-gauge rail lines could support traffic into the Soviet Union to forward rail heads."

Napoleon's Grande Armée of 610,000 men invaded Russia, heading towards Moscow, in 1812. The Russian army retreated before the French and again burnt their crops and villages, denying the enemy their use. Napoleon's army was ultimately reduced to 100,000. During the cold winter of 1941-1942, the Wehrmacht lacked necessary supplies, such as winter uniforms, due to the many delays in the German army's movements.

They counterproposed a division that would follow existing state boundaries, which ran along the eastern border of Iran, northern Afghanistan, the western border of China and then along the Yenisei River.\n \nHistorically, Hitler approved the Japanese proposal.

Whereas war in the past had often been based on religious, economic, and dynastic contexts, the eruption between National Socialist Germany and Soviet Russia was based upon both Hitler's desire for Lebensraum in the east and his ideological conviction that Bolshevism was the greatest threat to European civilization and would eventually seek to dominate the entire planet.\n \nThis modern crusade has been successful, and we have ensured the freedom of Europe from those that would seek to enslave her and her descendants.

The idea of The German Reich was born at the dawn of the XIX century with the beginning of the German nationalist movement and was first presented by Ernst Moritz Arndt (1769-1860). Arndt called for a United, strong and proud Kingdom, uniting all Germans. Again this topic arose during the revolution of 1848 at the Frankfurt Assembly, but its implementation was hampered by disagreements between the multinational Austrian movement and Prussia's desire to dominate in Germany. The essence of the problem was formulated as follows: to become a great Germany (Grossdeutsch) or to be a small German settlement (Kleindeutsch)? The latter would mean Prussian hegemony. The unification of Germany occurred under Otto von Bismarck in 1871 under the Kleindeutsch concept. For Hitler, an Austrian by birth, the Third Reich made no sense without the inclusion of Austria; moreover, great Germany could not exist without the accession of Czechoslovakia. Hitler embodied the idea of expansion from the first days of his regime: Germany returned to the Saarland, left the League of Nations, remilitarized Rhineland, annulled the Locarno agreement, carried out the Anschluss of Austria, captured Czechoslovakia. Great Germany included most of Western Europe in the first years of the WWII. By 1944, Germany issued postage stamps on which instead of "Deutsches Reich" was printed "Grossdeutsches Reich". Hitler practically carried out the aspirations of many German nationalists.\n \nThis Pan-german Empire will embody the vision of Hitler set out in "Mein Kampf", and will unite all the German peoples in a superpower, covering the entire continent and designed to create ideal conditions for the future civilization of the Aryan Race. This territory will include the whole of Greater Germany along with traditionally German regions such as the Netherlands, Belgium and the Scandinavian countries. In addition, all European Russia up to the Ural mountains will eventually become part of this state through the period of colonization.

Under the leadership of Goering, a plan was developed, called "Oldenburg", which provided for the mastery and service of the Reich of all reserves of raw materials and large industrial enterprises in the territory between the Vistula and the Urals. According to this plan, the most valuable industrial equipment was supposed to be sent to the Reich, and the one that can not be useful to Germany — to destroy. The territory of the European part of the USSR was planned to decentralize economically and make the agricultural raw material appendage of Germany. The initial version of the plan was approved at a secret meeting on March 1, 1941 (Protocol 1317 PS).\n \nOver the next two months, the plan was elaborated and finally approved on 29 April 1941 (minutes of the secret meeting 1157 P.S.). According to the plan, the territory of the USSR was divided into four economic inspectorates (Leningrad, Moscow, Kiev, Baku) and 23 economic commandant's offices, as well as 12 bureaus. For coordination the headquarters "Oldenburg" was formed. May 8, 1941 was the adoption of "General instructions for all Reich Commissars in the occupied Eastern territories" based on this plan (documents 1029, 1030 PS). A separate Commission was formed to organize the collection of food in the occupied territories. She was given the task to provide by 1942 the supply of the German armed forces with food completely at the expense of the resources of the USSR. All the rest of the food from the agricultural regions was supposed to be exported to Germany, thereby reducing the "excess population" of the industrial centers of the USSR. In accordance with the order of the chief of staff of the high command of the Wehrmacht Wilhelm Keitel of June 16, 1941, the main economic task in the occupied territories of the USSR was defined as "immediate and full exploitation of the occupied areas in the interests of the military economy of Germany, especially in the field of food and oil."\n \nReichsmarschall Goering, who directly headed the headquarters of "Oldenburg", wrote: "In the East, I intend to rob, and rob effectively. Everything that can be suitable for the Germans in the East, should be quickly extracted and delivered to Germany."\n \nAfter the beginning of the Barbarossa, July 15, 1941, he wrote in his "Green Folder": "The use of the areas to be occupied should be made primarily in the food and oil sectors of the economy. To get as much food and oil as possible for Germany is the main economic goal of the campaign."\n \nAfter the end of the war, the activities of the headquarters of Oldenburg became the subject of consideration and condemnation at the Nuremberg Tribunal."

BP_germany.600.d:0 "The involvement of Ireland in the Second World War is a little known historical curiosity. Officially neutral throughout the conflict, it did not go unnoticed by the participating powers that certain groups in Ireland had overlapping interests with the ambitions of the Third Reich, most notably antagonism between the Irish Republican Army and the question of Northern Ireland. The Allied powers also showed considerable interest in Ireland, and the country's leadership had to maintain a careful balance of diplomatic relations in order to not compromise their neutrality.\n \nWith the occupation of the British Isles, the area of Northern Ireland came under our control. We can now decide on how to best leverage this situation to advantage. If we were to grant these provinces to Ireland, we could easily bring them into our sphere of influence. Given the geopolitical situation with the collapse of the British Empire, they would realistically have no choice but to accept. This would then allow us to influence the leadership of Ireland to align with our vision of the European New Order, along with ensuring our security in the northern Atlantic and creating a counterweight towards the British.

BP_germany.601.d:0 "On 9 April 1940, at 06:30, German troops occupied the airport in Aalborg, built just two years earlier. For the first time in history, paratroops were used to spearhead an assault. The Germans soon established themselves there and by the following day, 10th April, operated more than 50 transport aircraft from the airport. The Germans needed Aalborg to maintain the supply line to the units fighting in Norway. They immediately began a major expansion and as soon as 13th July 1940 the first of two new concrete runways was operational.  Later came 19 wooden hangars, barracks, point-defense bunkers and flak (anti-aircraft) batteries.\n \nIn the course of the war, Aalborg-West together with the neighbouring aviator Horst Grove was expanded into one of the most fortified airfields of the Air Force in occupied Western Europe. Between November 1942 and the beginning of January 1944 there was a season of the IV.group of night hunting squadrons 3 (IV./NJG 3), which was initially equipped with Bf 110 and Do 217, in Aalborg-West. The latter was replaced by Ju 88C in the summer of 1943.\n \nFlight operations throughout the war were to provide supply and troop transport flights to and from Norway. In addition, operations included maritime reconnaissance over the North Sea, fighter escort for air strikes against northern England and Scotland and support of night-fighter operations and training. The base was attacked by the Royal Air Force in April 1940 in an unsuccessful attempted to prevent the Germans sending reinforcements to Norway.\n \nOn the other side of the Limfjord, just south of Aalborg West, the Germans started in late summer 1940 the construction of a seaplane base. A 300 metre long pier was constructed for mooring sea-planes ready for action. A crane could lift the aircraft onto land, if they needed maintenance in the large hangar. The development of the airfield continued throughout the war with bunkers and pillboxes for point defense, all surrounded by barbed wire. In all, 11 crew bunkers and a large hospital bunker were built to support the garrison of around 1,500 men. By the time of liberation in May 1945 the base acted as a sea rescue service facility, as well as a training center for future seaplane pilots."

This was the first mass act of physical violence against the Jewish people carried out by the Third Reich. As a result, people were killed, 30 thousand were sent to concentration camps, hundreds of synagogues were burnt down, and windows of houses and shop of Jews were broken. All the streets were covered with shards of glass-hence the name "Crystal Night". Then the official propaganda called these events the expression of Patriotic feelings of the German people. "Crystal Night" was a turning point in the fate of the Jewish people and a direct consequence of the most terrible crime in the history of the world – the Holocaust, which resulted in the destruction of 6 million Jews.\n \nThe USSR Newspapers published reports of protests against "Crystal Night" around the world, including a meeting held on November 15 in the Great hall of the Moscow Conservatory and adopted a resolution condemning Anti-Semitic excesses on behalf of the "Soviet intelligentsia". The President of the United States in protest only recalled from Berlin the American Ambassador for consultations. The protest was also expressed by Britain and France, but diplomatic relations with Nazi Germany did not break, and their ambassadors remained in Berlin.

Predominantly German-speaking in its central territories with a substantial Francophone population in the west and Italian and Romansch spoken in the south, the Swiss Confederation felt its multilingual, decentralized democracy was under extreme threat by Hitler's vision of a Greater Germanic Reich and the National Socialist worldview.\n \nAfter the fall of France, the fate of Switzerland is very uncertain, as its geostrategically important location makes it a potential military target. The occupation of Switzerland, with its well-developed transport infrastructure, could significantly ease the problem of supplying our troops in Africa and southern France. With a coordinated strike from Germany and France, supported by Italian troops, we can easily defeat Switzerland and keep its transport infrastructure intact.\n \nOn the other hand, investments in the Swiss military industry can become a much more profitable option for us. It would therefore be wise to convince them that the only way to maintain neutrality is to conclude an unequal trade agreement with the Axis powers."

Despite the strong position of British capital, which played a key role in the Iranian economy, the geopolitical bias towards the Third Reich became stronger. In addition, since 1933 Berlin has taken relations with Iran to a new qualitative level. Reich begins to take an active part in the development of the economy, infrastructure of Iran, the reform of the armed forces of the monarchy. In the Third Reich, Iranian youth, the military, whom Goebbels propaganda called "Sons of Zaratushtra", are being trained. German ideologists declared the Persians "Pure Aryans" and they were exempted from the Nuremberg Racial Laws by a special decree. As a result, by the beginning of the Second World War, the Third Reich had gained a strong position in Iran, and in fact the country was turning into a German base in the Middle East region. By 1941, the situation with Iran and its "aryan bias" for Moscow and London was as follows: there was a real threat that Iran's oil and transport infrastructure built on British capital will be used by the Third Reich against the USSR and Britain. Thus, only one oil refinery in Abadan processed 8 million tons of oil in 1940. And aviation gasoline in the whole region was produced only in Baku and Abadan. In addition, if the German armed forces broke from North Africa to Palestine, Syria, or in 1942 reached the border of Baku – Derbent – Astrakhan, Turkey and Iran's entry into the war on the side of Germany would be a matter resolved. In connection with the planned offensive of the Wehrmacht deep into the Soviet Union, the Persian corridor, passing through the territory of the trans-Iranian railway, was one of the easiest ways to implement the lend-lease program implemented by the United States by sea. British and Soviet engineers recognized the great importance of this railway and sought to keep it under close attention. The increased number of attacks by German submarines and the ice covering of the sea in the area of Arkhangelsk have increased the danger of using this route, so that the need for the use of the railway has increased significantly. Moreover, the Soviet government sought to include Iran, Azerbaijan and Turkmensahra ("Turkmen plain") part of the state, and to bring to power in Iran, the Communists. The pressure of the UK and the USSR on Iran led to an increase in tension and a massive anti-British speech in Tehran, which, according to the British, were of a Pro-German nature. Iran's strategic position hampered the security of the Soviet oil-producing areas and the rear of the red Army and threatened British military routes between India and the Mediterranean."

BP_japan.1.t:0 "2600th Anniversary Celebrations of the Japanese Empire"
BP_japan.1.d:0 "In 1940, amid war in China and growing tensions with the United States, Japan celebrated the 26th centennial of the founding of the Empire of Japan and the 'unbroken' imperial line. This was a carefully choreographed commemoration, one aimed at stoking nationalism, devotion to the emperor and support for imperial expansion. It was an assertion of modern identity couched in crafted traditions and myths, one that evoked a powerful public endorsement evident in various enthusiastic expressions ranging from volunteer work brigades to dutiful pilgrimages to sacred sites. The celebrations were also aimed at shoring up national morale as the death toll from war against China had reached 100,000. Invoking the virtues of the Yamato race and continuous imperial rule promoted stoic perseverance in the face of adversity, rendering sacrifice a patriotic duty. Little did anyone imagine that only five years later the glorious Empire would collapse in ignominious defeat."

BP_japan.2.d:0 "The Great Liberation, or as the outside world would call it, the Second Sino-Japanese War has come to an end. Like the victory of a noble Samurai over an common brigand, the Imperial Japanese Army beheaded national China. With this decisive victory, the Chinese people are now protected from European imperialism. In the historic Chinese capital of Nanjing, a conclusive peace treaty has been signed between Hirohito's entourage and the leaders of the Reorganized National Government of the Republic of China. With Wang Jingwei as its head of state, their legality as the legitimate representative of all Chinese peoples has been recognized by the signatories of the Anti-Comintern Pact. \n \nTriumphant parades march through Tokyo, the banner of The Rising Sun adorning every building. Children and adults wave flags with a sense of pride for their country. Petals of cherry blossoms soar around the city, and smiling girls give flowers to soldiers who returned from the front. The IJA (Imperial Japanese Army) and the IJN (Imperial Japanese Navy) set aside their animosity, and the Japanese Navy stages demonstrations in the harbor in a display of national strength and unity. Tokyo's residents look on in awe, the victory emboldening their belief in our divine mission. Our vision of the Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere is becoming a reality! \n \nYet now is not the time to rest - many challenges still lie ahead. Though the war in China is over, the population is restless and it will take great effort to suppress the remaining resistance. The Europeans still need to be removed from the Pacific, and the USSR eyes us with growing suspicion in the cold reaches of Siberia. Today, however, the Japanese people celebrate their greatest victory. With the guiding light of the Rising Sun, we will lead all of Asia into a glorious future!"

As Nanjing came under attack, the capital was again moved, this time to Chongqing. Knowing that Japanese troops were en route toward the city, the people panicked and tried to flee. On December 9th, 1937, Japanese ground forces reached Nanjing, where they were met with minimal resistance from overwhelmed and fatigued Chinese military units. By December 13th, with Japanese troops attacking the city from all angles, the Chinese forces were routed. Fearing the consequences of surrender to the Japanese, Chinese military men donned civilian clothing and retreated into the city. It was on this day that the six-week stretch of atrocities against the civilian population of Nanjing began. The news of the massacre soon hit the world and significantly deteriorated Japan's relations with the Democratic countries of the world.;A l'automne 1937, des avions japonais bombardent Nankin, concentrant leurs efforts sur le centre de la ville, le quartier le plus peuplй de... civils !

BP_japan.201.d:0 "Since the XIX century Russian pioneers began active development of the Far East, which was largely due to the rapid weakening of the power of the Qing Empire, which in 1840 was involved in the first Opium war. The result of these events was the signing between China and Russia of The Aigun and Beijing agreements, which transferred to the Russian territory of Manchuria, which is now known as the Amur region. The result of attempts to strengthen Russia's influence in our region was our confrontation and the subsequent victory in the Russian-Japanese war.\n \nFearing our threat, the Bolsheviks organized the Far Eastern Republic (FER) - a de jure independent democratic state with a capitalist economy, proclaimed on the territory of Transbaikalia and the Russian Far East. It existed until 1922, when the Soviets annexed it.\n \nNow that we control this territory, we need to decide what to do with it: to create a new FER to attract Russian-white immigrants and loyal population and to return the territory of Manchuria, to restore its old borders."

Living in extreme natural and climatic conditions of the North, the aborigines conducted their respective extensive economy; they were politically poorly organized, lived in childbirth, and only the Yakuts were partially United in larger tribal communities.\n \nIn 1623 this territory was opened by Russian Cossacks, and in 1632 Cossack Peter Beketov founded the first Russian city of Lensky Ostrog on the territory of Yakutia, later named Yakutsk. This date is considered the date of entry of Yakutia into The Russian state.\n \nIn the early 20th century and against the backdrop of the Civil War, in Yakutia began to spread the idea of independence and self-identity of the Yakut people. The result of these ideas were the uprisings that took place in 1921-1928. The uprisings were a series of armed clashes in different regions of Yakutia, battles were fought in 1921-1923 - between the red and white guards, in 1924-1925 between the authorities of the Yakut ASSR and the so-called Tunguska rebels, in 1927-1928 between the local administration and the confederalists who wanted to achieve independence Yakutia from the RSFSR.\n \nNow that we control this area, we can decide what to do with it.

M. Semenov came to power in the Republic, who single-handedly managed this political entity, made Baikal a Japanese puppet.\n \nWith the formation of the Far Eastern Republic — the protectorate of Soviet Russia in the Far East — the futility of military confrontation became obvious. October 19, 1920 Japan began the withdrawal of troops from Transbaikalia, and on the same day of the Amur front NRA FER began the offensive on Chita. November 21, 1920 was completed the liberation of Transbaikalia, which marked the end of the Trans-Baikal white state.\n \nSemenov was in emigration, as well as many white guards of the Far East, he stayed to live in Manchuria and cooperated with the Japanese authorities."

Moreover, Japan was not prepared for the protracted nature of the war. The gigantic size of the occupied zone did not match the military capabilities of Tokyo. Hoping to create a mechanism of political control over the occupied territory, the invaders went to the creation of local puppet Chinese authorities. On December 14, 1937, Beijing proclaimed the establishment of the Provisional government of the Republic of China, headed by Wang Kemin in the North, and on March 28, 1938, Nanjing established a Reformed government of the Republic of China, headed by Liang Hongzhi, which controlled the southern and Central regions.\n \nWang Jinwei, as one of the leaders of the Kuomintang party, rose to Pro-Japanese positions during the war, and in December 1938 fled from Chongqing (where the temporary capital of the Republic of China was located) to Hanoi, the Territory of French Indochina, where he proposed to start peace talks with Japan on December 29, 1938. Being wounded by Chinese agents, he moved to Japanese-controlled Shanghai three months later, where he entered into negotiations with the Japanese authorities. In January 1940, a number of members of the Kuomintang (Wang Jinwei, Chen Gunbo, Zhou Fohai, Tao Shisheng, etc.) held a meeting in Qingdao, where they developed proposals to "re-establish" the Kuomintang government.

Second were those territories that would fall under the control of a number of tightly-controlled pro-Japanese vassal states based on the model of Manchukuo, as nominally "independent" members of the Greater East Asian alliance.\n \nAccording to the plan, a strategically important Chinese territory, such as Hong Kong, Qingdao, Shanghai, Hainan, etc will remain under direct Japanese rule. The plan also included large-scale colonization of some conquered lands. In this Japanese version of Lebensraum, it was assumed that The Chinese coast would be dotted with "Japanese living space" - these areas were to be inhabited by Japanese colonists, and the local Chinese population would be evicted or aggressively "Japanized" to live among the colonists."

At the beginning of WWII, the plan was expanded and refined to counter the potential invasion of Nazi Germany, which was planned, but never took place.The term "Redoubt" originally refers to a system of fortifications built since the 1880s to protect Central Switzerland as a fortified area for the retreat of the Swiss army. It was a complex of fortifications in the Alps along the lines of "East-West" with the three main fortresses: Saint-Maurice, Saint Gotthard and Sargans. These fortresses primarily defended the Alpine passages between Germany and Italy and did not cover the industrial densely populated interior of Switzerland. Inland areas, in turn, were under the protection of fortifications, "Borderline" and "Army line" — a significant, but non insurmountable. On the contrary, the redoubt complex of structures is designed as completely impregnable, which would not give the aggressor the opportunity to cross the Alps from North to South through mountain passes or railway tunnels. This strategy was to contain any invasion, making it meaningless because of the impossibility of using the Swiss transport infrastructure."

"Today we celebrate the fruits of our efforts!", he spoke today from the Reichstag, “The greatest threat that has ever existed to the German peoples, the people of Europe, and the civilized nations of the world is no more.” In his victory speech, the Fuehrer announced that former Soviet Union will be split between the Reich and the Japanese Empire: The Japanese would gain control over Kamchatka, Vladivostok, Khabarovsk and the greater territory of Eastern Siberia, while the Reich would gain control over Western Siberia. It is planned to create a Siberian "Neutral Zone" between the two States as a sign of good will, as well as to minimize possible military incidents between the two countries."

After the landing of German troops on the British Isles and the fall of London, it became clear that America can no longer afford to sit in the face of German aggression. The official declaration of war was delivered to the German embassy in Washington, and American diplomats in Berlin were ordered to return to the States immediately. The Atlantic fleet has left its home port of Norfolk. “The fate of the free world,” - said President Roosevelt in his declaration to Congress this morning, “...cannot be allowed to fall into the hands of those who wish to extinguish its light. Our will remains unconquerable, remains firm, remains uncowed, remains eternal, and most of all, our will, and the will of all peoples who have this holy duty, remains free!”"

According to various estimates of witnesses and experts, between 40,000 and more than 500,000 Chinese civilians and disarmed soldiers were killed, as well as many rapes and looting. In the case of resistance or anything that seems disapproving, the Japanese use the execution, using bayonets, swords and other orie. The entire Japanese army seems free to do as they please."

The regime of Regent Abd al-Ilah was overthrown, and Rashid Ali al-Ghailani was declared Prime Minister. The coup was led by four Iraqi generals, who were in the nationalist group 'Golden Square'. Rumor has it that this group was funded by the German government. According to the rebels, in 1930 Iraq gained only formal independence because of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty imposed by great Britain. The new government announced the cancellation of all contracts with Britain and requires the withdrawal Of British bases from the territory of Iraq.

His tenure was accompanied by rivalry between the secret services loyal to the protector and the party structures caused by the overlapping competence of different branches of power. This, and the lack of rigidity of Neurath during the suppression of Czech resistance, resulted in his actual removal from office.\n \nAt the end of September 1941, Hitler summoned von Neurath and said that he had decided to appoint him Deputy Heydrich. Von Neurath disagreed with this decision and announced his resignation from this post. Then Hitler sent von Neurath on "indefinite vacation". His duties were transferred to Heydrich as "acting reichsprotektor of Bohemia and Moravia" (ger. "Stellvertretender Reichsprotektor von Böhmen und Mähren").\n \nThus, Heydrich became the actual Reichsprotektor (von Neurath never returned to his duties), retaining the post of head of the Directorate of the RSHA. On September 27, 1941, Heydrich took up residence in Hradcany. His summer residence, which moved his family, Heydrich gave in to get him after the resignation of K. von Neurath, the so-called "Lower Palace" in the town Panenske-Brzezany 15 km to the North from Prague, confiscated from sharoprokatnogo Jewish origin of Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer."

In addition, since 1933 Berlin has taken relations with Iran to a new qualitative level. The Reich has begun to take an active part in the development of the economy, infrastructure of Iran, and the reform of the armed forces of the monarchy. In the Third Reich, Iranian youth, the military, whom Goebbels propaganda calls "Sons of Zaratushtra", are being trained. German ideologists declared the Persians "Pure Aryans" and they were exempted from the Nuremberg Racial Laws by a special decree. As a result, by the beginning of the Second World War, the Third Reich had gained a strong position in Iran, and in fact the country was turning into a German base in the Middle East region.\n \nIn recent weeks, the situation has changed and now we can try to attract Iran to our side."

In the supporters of Great Italy also considered Albania, Montenegro, Northern Tunisia. They also insisted on a closer incorporation of Northern Libya, conquered ("General terms") in 1911-1912. The project involved the creation of an Italian state in which non-Italian elements would be assimilated and Italian colonization encouraged.\n \nThe supposed expansion would help Italy regain the Mediterranean domination lost after the fall of the Roman Empire. In preparation for the war with France, in 1940, the fascist regime "took aim" at Corsica, nice, Savoy, Tunisia and Djibouti. On 10 June 1940, the foreign Minister, count Ciano, came up with the idea of dividing Switzerland between Germany and Italy: the cantons of Ticino, graubünden and Valais could move to the latter.

The Hanko Peninsula was leased to the USSR as a naval base.Occupation of Norway by Germany, which cut off Finland from direct ties with great Britain and France, led to the fact that since may 1940 Finland has committed to strengthening relations with Nazi Germany. At this time in Germany on the orders of Adolf Hitler began to develop a plan of attack on the Soviet Union, Finland acquired the interest for Germany as a base for the deployment of troops and a base for military operations, as well as a possible ally in the war against the Soviet Union. On August 19, 1940, the German government terminated the arms embargo on Finland in exchange for allowing the use of Finnish territory for the transit of German troops to Norway. Although Finland was still suspicious of Germany because of its policies during the Winter war, the Finns saw it as the only Savior.Finland expressed its readiness to join Germany in its war against the USSR under several conditions:\n \nGuarantee of independence of Finland;\n \nReturn the border with the USSR to pre-war (or better) condition;\n \nContinuation of the food supply;\n \n pFinland is not an aggressor, that is, enters the war only after being attacked by the Soviet Union.\n \n21—June 25 from the territory of Finland against the USSR acted naval and air forces of Germany. 22 Jun 1941 in response to the occupation of the Finnish troops of the demilitarized zone of åland of the Finnish troops was bombed by Soviet aviation.

Despite the strong position of British capital, which played a key role in the Iranian economy, the geopolitical bias towards the Third Reich became stronger. In addition, since 1933 Berlin has taken relations with Iran to a new qualitative level. Reich begins to take an active part in the development of the economy, infrastructure of Iran, the reform of the armed forces of the monarchy. In the Third Reich, Iranian youth, the military, whom Goebbels propaganda called "Sons of Zaratushtra", are being trained. German ideologists declared the Persians "Pure Aryans" and they were exempted from the Nuremberg Racial Laws by a special decree. As a result, by the beginning of the Second World War, the Third Reich had gained a strong position in Iran, and in fact the country was turning into a German base in the Middle East region. By 1941, the situation with Iran and its "Aryan bias" for Moscow and London was as follows: there was a real threat that Iran's oil and transport infrastructure built on British capital will be used by the Third Reich against the USSR and Britain. Thus, only one oil refinery in Abadan processed 8 million tons of oil in 1940. And aviation gasoline in the whole region was produced only in Baku and Abadan. In addition, if the German armed forces broke from North Africa to Palestine, Syria, or in 1942 reached the border of Baku – Derbent – Astrakhan, Turkey and Iran's entry into the war on the side of Germany would be a matter resolved. In connection with the planned offensive of the Wehrmacht deep into the Soviet Union, the Persian corridor, passing through the territory of the TRANS-Iranian railway, was one of the easiest ways to implement the lend-lease program implemented by the United States by sea. British and Soviet engineers recognized the great importance of this railway and sought to keep it under close attention. The increased number of attacks by German submarines and the ice covering of the sea in the area of Arkhangelsk have increased the danger of using this route, so that the need for the use of the railway has increased significantly. Moreover, the Soviet government sought to include Iran, Azerbaijan and Turkmensahra ("Turkmen plain") part of the state, and to bring to power in Iran, the Communists. The pressure of the UK and the USSR on Iran led to an increase in tension and a massive anti-British speech in Tehran, which, according to the British, were of a Pro-German nature. Iran's strategic position hampered the security of the Soviet oil-producing areas and the rear of the red Army and threatened British military routes between India and the Mediterranean."
