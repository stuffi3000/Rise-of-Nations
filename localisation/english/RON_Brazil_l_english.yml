 bra_antropofagia_imperial_fascista_desc:0 "Although only recently described by the Modernists, the absorption of the customs of other cultures and their adaptation to the national reality are the central foundation of the Brazilian identity. Brazil is not a country formed by different cultures that inhabit the same space, but by a single Brazilian culture, organized through the hybridization of European, African, Asian and indigenous cultures. A Brazilian, therefore, can not be identified through race or custom, but only through the use of the mother tongue and the sense of belonging to Brazil. This peculiarity built a disenchanted people and a disinterested government when it comes to external affairs, but extremely resilient and tolerant of other cultures, as well as citizens loyal to the brazilian uniqueness."
