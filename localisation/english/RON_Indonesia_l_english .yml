indonesia.104.t:0 "Peace Denied!"
indonesia.104.desc:0 "Despite our good intentions, all offers for peace have been rejected, our war must continue, no matter the cost."
indonesia.104.a:0 "Diplomacy never did us any good anyway."

indonesia.105.t:0 "The new governor"
indonesia.105.desc:0 "The retirement of Cornelis de Jonge as Governor-general of the East Indies marks the end of an era. A strong, stubborn man, Jonge was firmly opposed to local autonomy and was also firmly pro-Dutch in his administration, rejecting most efforts to increase colonial autonomy. His replacement, Stachouwer, has yet to decide which way he will point the administration, but many are hoping for a breath of fresh air to kickstart independence movements."
indonesia.105.a:0 "May he govern well."

indonesia.106.t:0 "Kebangkitan"
indonesia.106.desc:0 "The Netherlands East Indies lies at a crossroads, though sheltered from the great war, the colonial administration has not escaped the growing movements for native independence. Fueled by the rising power of Japan and the growing modernisation of the colony, native figures have arisen championing Independence under many banners. From the East, the fascist pro-Japanese champion the Right of Nationhood, the workers demand greater control over the fruits of their labour, and even the most sympathetic politicans are demanding a true democratic government. Whether the overburdened and undersupported colonial government will be able to quell these demands, or fall under wave of Independence, only time will tell."
indonesia.106.a:0 "Wij Zal Handhaven."
