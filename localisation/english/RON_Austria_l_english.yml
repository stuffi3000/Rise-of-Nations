During this period of time, several European empires—primarily Spain, Portugal, Britain, and France—began to explore and claim the natural resources and human capital of the Americas, resulting in the displacement and disestablishment of some Indigenous Nations, and the establishment of several settler-colonial states. Some formerly European settler colonies—including New Mexico, Alaska, the Prairies/northern Great Plains, and the "Northwest Territories" in North America; the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, the Yucatán Peninsula, and the Darién Gap in Central America; and the northwest Amazon, the central Andes, and the Guianas in South America—remain relatively rural, sparsely populated and Indigenous into the 21st century, however several settler-colonial states, including Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Argentina, and the United States grew into settler-colonial empires in their own right. Russia began colonizing the Pacific Northwest, starting in the mid-eighteenth century, seeking pelts for the fur trade. Many of the social structures—including religions, political boundaries, and linguae francae—which predominate the western hemisphere in the 21st century are the descendants of the structures which were established during this period."

 austria.1131.b:0 "We can and will take all they have!"

 austria.1142.t:0 "Germany has withheld Krakow"
 austria.1142.d:0 "Germany has denied us Krakow, retaining access of the city and denying us ancient Austro-Hungarian land. A questionable decision, for sure."
 austria.1142.a:0 "Questionable, but implacable."

 austria.1143.d:0 "The political machinations of Italy gained us a part of Tyrol after the Great War. The Austrians intend to reclaim the territory in time - and we intend to claim Dalmatia. Perhaps an agreement can be reached...?"

 austria.1144.t:0 "Italy has agreed to our deal"
 austria.1144.d:0 "The Italians have accepted our offer, agreeing to move their troops out of Dalmatia as we move ours out of Tyrol. The exchange is effective immediately."

 austria.1145.t:0 "Italy has refused our deal"
 austria.1145.d:0 "The Italians have decided that their claim over the Italian majority in Dalmatia is worth more than their dubious claim to the rest of Tyrol. They have refused our offer."
 austria.1145.a:0 "Perhaps for the best."
 
 austria.1146.t:0 "Austria demands the Istrian Peninsula"
 austria.1146.d:0 "The Austrians have demanded the Istrian peninsula, a stronghold of Austro-Hungarian naval superiority since before the Great War. Denying them could mean consequences."

 austria.1146.b:0 "We can deal with consequences."

 austria.1147.a:0 "Perfect!"
 
 austria.1148.t:0 "Italy has refused our demands"
 austria.1148.d:0 "The Italians have foolishly stood up to us. Perhaps it is time we show the upstarts that beating us once does not guarantee victory again."
 austria.1148.a:0 "Are they prepared for war?"
 
 austria.1149.t:0 "Austrian invitation"
 austria.1149.d:0 "The Austrian government has extended an invitation to a military alliance headed by their own empire. A powerful ally to have - but do we need their help?"
 austria.1149.a:0 "Any help in these unstable times is welcome."
 austria.1149.b:0 "We can forge our own way."
 
 austria.1150.t:0 "Austrian Ultimatum"

 austria.1150.a:0 "We will protect our citizens' way of life!"
 austria.1150.b:0 "It seems we must accept Austrian leadership."
 
 austria.1151.t:0 "Greece has refused our ultimatum"
 austria.1151.d:0 "The impudent Greeks have delivered a stinging slap to the face, denying our offer of political and military protection. Such an overt gesture is absolutely an act of war!"
 austria.1151.a:0 "And we will treat it as such!"
 
 austria.1152.t:0 "Greece has succumbed to our ultimatum"
 austria.1152.d:0 "Greece has wisely accepted our offer of protection in these dark and troubled times. Their government has changed hands with minimal fuss to our control and they will operate as part of our coalition."
 austria.1152.a:0 "The wiser choice to make."
 
 austria.1153.t:0 "Austrian invitation"
 austria.1153.d:0 "Our old allies, the Austrians, have extended an arm in friendship, offering a resurrection of the old Central Powers. Perhaps it is time to rejoin with our old Ottoman allies?"

 austria.1154.a:0 "And neither have we."
 
 austria.1155.t:0 "Turkey has refused to join us"
 austria.1155.d:0 "Turkey, it seems, has forgotten how loyally we stood by each other in the Great War. They have denied our alliance, and will go their own way."
 austria.1155.a:0 "A troubling concept."
 
 austria.1156.t:0 "We have beaten back the Soviets"
 austria.1156.d:0 "The Ukranian uprising has been going well, relatively, speaking, and yet the Soviet bear is still a worrying presence above us. We can keep pushing if we believe we can take more ground - or we can deliver a peace deal."
 austria.1156.a:0 "We will offer peace - with conditions."
 austria.1156.b:0 "The Soviets cannot be allowed to continue!"
 
 austria.1157.t:0 "The Ukrainian Armistice"
 austria.1157.d:0 "The Austrians have delivered a peace deal. Considering how the war has been going, the terms are generous - an immediate ceasefire, in exchange for freedom for the Russian Ukraine. Should we accept?"
 austria.1157.a:0 "It seems necessary."
 austria.1157.b:0 "Not until the last man is dead!"
 
 austria.1158.t:0 "The Soviets have conceded"
 austria.1158.d:0 "The Soviets have accepted a ceasefire. The Ukraine is in the hands of the Ukrainians, and the Ukranians are very grateful to us. A major victory."
 austria.1158.a:0 "And another step in our plans."
 
 austria.1159.t:0 "The Soviets have refused"
 austria.1159.d:0 "The Soviets have decided that their interests are better served by a long, grinding war. Evidence of the true Soviet view of the value of the worker, perhaps?"
 austria.1159.a:0 "For the sake of our own, we will end this quickly."
 
 austria.1160.t:0 "We have achieved our goals"
 austria.1160.d:0 "The Ukranian uprising has gone well, and a free Ukranian state is now a possibility. We can deliver a peace deal to the Soviets - peace, for Ukranian freedom. A more reasonable offer, we could not make."
 austria.1160.a:0 "Anything to bring democracy to the Ukraine."
 austria.1160.b:0 "The Soviets cannot be trusted to remain peaceful."

 AUS_support_weapons2:0 "MG 34"
 AUS_support_weapons2_desc:0 "The versatile MG 34 was arguably the most advanced machine gun in the world at the time of its deployment. Its combination of exceptional mobility – being light enough to be carried by one man – and high rate of fire (of up to 900 rounds per minute) was unmatched."
 AUS_support_weapons3:0 "MG 42"
 AUS_support_weapons3_desc:0 "Intended to replace the earlier MG 34, the MG 42 has a proven record of reliability, durability, simplicity, and ease of operation, but is most notable for its ability to produce a high volume of suppressive fire. The MG 42 had one of the highest average cyclic rates of any single-barreled man-portable machine gun: between 1,200 and 1,500 rpm, resulting in a distinctive muzzle report compared to the sound of a power saw or tearing linoleum."
 AUS_support_weapons4:0 "MG 45"
 AUS_support_weapons4_desc:0 "The MG 45 differed from the MG 42 in that it did not completely lock its breech before firing, increasing its rate of fire and simplifying its construction. In 1945, the material shortages of the Third Reich led to the development of a newer version of the MG 42, the MG 45 (or MG 42V). The tested MG 45/42V fired 120,000 rounds in succession at a rate of fire around 1,350 rounds per minute."
