During this period of time, several European empires—primarily Spain, Portugal, Britain, and France—began to explore and claim the natural resources and human capital of the Americas, resulting in the displacement and disestablishment of some Indigenous Nations, and the establishment of several settler-colonial states. Some formerly European settler colonies—including New Mexico, Alaska, the Prairies/northern Great Plains, and the "Northwest Territories" in North America; the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, the Yucatán Peninsula, and the Darién Gap in Central America; and the northwest Amazon, the central Andes, and the Guianas in South America—remain relatively rural, sparsely populated and Indigenous into the 21st century, however several settler-colonial states, including Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Argentina, and the United States grew into settler-colonial empires in their own right. Russia began colonizing the Pacific Northwest, starting in the mid-eighteenth century, seeking pelts for the fur trade. Many of the social structures—including religions, political boundaries, and linguae francae—which predominate the western hemisphere in the 21st century are the descendants of the structures which were established during this period."

According to the Pilot, just as they were about to make the Channel crossing, the Grand Duke burst into the cockpit, informing them that Princess Cecilie had gone into labour. Alarmed for the Princess' condition, the Pilot made a snap decision to turn around and make for Ostend airfied to seek medical assistance. With fog and rain covering the area, visibility was low, necessitating a low-altitude flight to be able to see the airfield. Just minutes away from the airfield however, the pilot was taken by surprise as he found himself flying straight for a factory chimney that had suddenly emerged from the gloom in front of him. With some last-second manoeuvres, he spun the plane along its axis, narrowly avoiding the chimney, and leaving Belgian onlookers aghast. Though they suffered some scrapes and bruises from the sudden movement, the Ducal family was largely unharmed from the close-shave, and successfully disembarked at Ostend to attend to the Princess' needs.\n\n Though they have all been shaken somewhat by the experience, the Grand Duke has expressed his thanks to the pilot's quick-thinking, and we all shudder to think what tragedy would have occured if the plane had crashed. Princess Cecilie is now taking some well-deserved time off, whist the Grand Duke is making prepations for a fresh flight to Britain, hoping this that time, there will be no scares."

If we are to succeed however, we must convince the claimants to German titles to join us in our conspiracy, and generate for them some public support so that they may rise up against the Nazi regime. Though it is not necessary to get all of them on side, the more claimants we can get involved, the more seperate risings we will be able to pull off, making it harder for the Reich to counteract us.\n\n This undertaking is a considerable risk for our potential allies, and they may need some convincing to join our side. Some of them may even have mixed loyalties, or even actively support the Nazi regime currently, and will only consider joining us under certain conditions. For some cases, we have lined up multiple candidates for a title where the primary candidate has known connections to the Nazi Party, so it may be preferable in these cases to convince this secondary candidate instead. \n\n Acceptance for joining our conspiracy will be effected by the §GStrength§! of our plot in the §Gnumber of conspirators§!, Their §YLocation§! in comparison to §Yourselves and other conspirators§!, and successes the Nazi Party have had in §RForeign Policy§!"

Their ideological differences to us do not matter right now, what only matters is their anti-german stance. Their support can be received if we stop the prosecution of socialist ideologies."

In order to get a step ahead of the Nazis Schuschnigg has planned to hold a Plebiscite to decide the fate of Austria for all the world to see. Of course this Plebiscite will happen on our terms and we can trust that we would be likely to win it, as long as the Germans do not interfere directly.

During the Great War he was deployed on the Russian, French and Italian fronts and rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel.

In this role he led the military actions of the Volkswehr in the Carinthian defensive campaign. After the defensive battle, Hülgerth was initially only deployed as a battalion commander in Burgenland. It was not until 1923 that he was promoted to colonel and regimental commander, from May 12, 1923 to June 21, 1923 of the Burgenland-Lower Austrian Infantry Regiment Carl Duke of Lorraine No. 13 of the Federal Army and from June 21, 1923 to December 31, 1924 of the Lower Austrian Infantry Regiment General of the Infantry Carl Vaugoin No. 5.

 POLITICS_ERNST_STARHEMBERG_DESC:0 "Born in Eferding, Upper Austria, in 1899, into the illustrious House of Starhemberg which hailed from a long line of Austrian nobles and §Yinherited the title of prince§!. In World War I he served on the Italian Front and then in 1921 was a member of Freikorps Oberland. \nSeeking election to the Bundesrat, the representation of Austrian states at age 21, Starhemberg became a proponent of Catholic and conservative politics and joined the Heimatschutz, quickly becoming a leader of one of its local branches. He also became an admirer of Benito Mussolini and his Fascist government. In the early 1920s, Starhemberg traveled to Germany and had contacts with the nascent Nazi movement. After seeing the failed Beer Hall Putsch of 1923, Starhemberg became disenchanted with Nazism and returned to Austria. Rejoining the Heimatschutz, Starhemberg became §Yits national leader§! Eventually, Starhemberg's movement became powerful enough to §Yinfluence the government§!, and as such the chancellor appointed him Minister of the Interior in September 1930. Starhemberg resigned his position shortly thereafter however. When conservative Engelbert §YDollfuß became Chancellor of Austria in 1932, Starhemberg once again gained governmental power§!. Upon Dollfuß' assassination two months later during a failed coup by the Nazis, Starhemberg briefly came to head the government. As President Wilhelm Miklas proclaimed Austria was §Ynot yet ready for a "Heimwehr Cabinet"§!, called a cabinet meeting in Vienna's Ballhouse surrounded by barbed wire and government troops to restrain suspicious members of the Heimwehr, who claimed the Nazi coup had been foiled only through their courage, and appointed Kurt von Schuschnigg Chancellor instead on 29 July. \nIn 1936, Starhemberg's §Ydisagreements with Schuschnigg§!, who, inspired by the appeasement policies of the western democracies, wanted to improve relations with Nazi Germany rather than risk invasion by a far stronger Wehrmacht and face possible desertion by Hitler's new-found ally, Mussolini. Now however, with Starhemberg at the helm of the nation, he seems free to finally §Yshape Austria truly in his vision§!."
 POLITICS_AUS_RICHARD_STEIDLE_DESC:0 "Born in 1881 in then austrian South Tyrol, he grew up to study at the University of Innsbruck, completing his doctorate in jurisprudence. As the Great War broke out, Steidle was redeemed unfit for military service and instead became an assistant to a military court. With the end of the War, he took up work as a lawyer. In 1920 the Heimwehr in Tirol was established, with Steidle being appointed "Landesführer" of the group. The new group's stated intention was the prevention of further loss of territory to Italy, however, for his part Steidle saw the sole aim of Heimwehr as being anti-communist. \n\nHaving become one of the leading figures in the Heimwehr, Steidle was in 1927 chosen as the group's overall leader in a largely unsuccessful attempt to create unity amongst the disparate regional groups. In this role he worked closely with §YWaldemar Pabst§! in an attempt to improve the organisation of the Heimwehr, with Steidle seeking to build up the Heimwehr as a political movement and Pabst concentrating on improving the military side of the group. This however ultimately failed and §YErnst Rüdiger Starhemberg§! became the new leader of the Heimwehren. \n\nSteidle grew closer to the anti-Nazism of the Austrofascists who came to dominate Austrian politics in the mid-1930s and in 1934 he was appointed Consul general in Trieste under Kurt Schuschnigg's government. As the second Civil War broke out in Austria Steidle returned to support the Heimwehren in it, and with the death of Starhemberg now finds himself once more heading the Heimwehr as its leader."

The Slovene spelling of the family name is Šušnik. He received his education at the Stella Matutina Jesuit College in Feldkirch, Vorarlberg. During World War I, he was taken prisoner at the Italian Front and held captive until September 1919. Subsequently, he studied law at the University of Freiburg and the University of Innsbruck, where he became a member of the Catholic fraternity A.V.

He graduated from the Piaristengymnasium in Krems, enlisted as a one-year volunteer in 1918, studied chemistry and in 1920 joined the Hirtenberger cartridge factory under his father's general management. In 1921, the Hirtenberg cartridge factory supplied Poland with armaments in the war against Soviet Russia. Because of this, communist workers set the factory on fire. In addition, throughout the 1920s the factory struggled with the ban on exporting arms resulting from the Treaty of Saint-Germain. Young Mandl found ways to get around such difficulties. From 1924 he managed the factory. Later he was also the owner of the Lichtenwörth cartridge factory and the Grünbach hard coal mining industry. In 1928 he represented the Hirtenberger cartridge factory as the Austrian partner in a joint venture in Solothurn, Switzerland. The other partner, the major corporation Rheinmetall, together with Krupp the second largest German arms manufacturer, was represented by the weapons engineer Hans Eltze. The Solothurn weapons factory was used as a cover for the export of German and Austrian weapons, especially anti-tank guns and anti-aircraft guns under the Swiss label. Through his connections to the Heimwehr, Mandl also became friends with their chief of staff, the German major Waldemar Pabst, who had organized the double murder of Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht and had taken part in several attempted coups."

At the outbreak of war he served as a first lieutenant in the No. 6 Horse Artillery Division on the Eastern Front. In July 1915 he successfully applied for a transfer to the aviation troops. He began his flying career as an observer with Fliegerkompanie 1 (FliK 1) in Czernowitz under Otto Jindra, as his observer he also flew most of the time. He took part in the bombing raid by aviation troops on the occasion of Tsar Nicholas II and Brusilov's visit to the front near Khotyn (Bessarabia) on April 12, 1916. Of seven Russian planes that were sent to intercept the Austro-Hungarian planes, Brumowski shot down two. He subsequently received flight training and completed his training as a field pilot on July 3, 1916. In November 1916 he was transferred to Fliegerkompanie 12 on the Italian front, where he achieved his fifth confirmed kill in January 1917. \n\nIn February 1917, the first real Austro-Hungarian fighter group FliK 41J was formed and Brumowski was given command of the unit. Before he was supposed to take over, he was assigned to the German Jasta 24 fighter squadron for a short time. There he was supposed to study the tactics on the Western Front and incorporate his knowledge into the Flik 41J. On this occasion he met Manfred von Richthofen, after whose example he later had his aircraft painted red. From his return in April 1917 he remained in command of the Flik 41J until shortly before the end of the war. The Flik 41J had the reputation of being the best unit in the aviation troops. Many of the best Austro-Hungarian fighter pilots flew in the unit, such as Frank Linke-Crawford, Kurt Gruber, Karl Kaszala, Friedrich Navratil, Josef Novak and temporarily also Julius Arigi and Benno Fiala von Fernbrugg. Brumowski was in command of all Austro-Hungarian fighter pilot companies on the Isonzo Front during the final weeks of the war. \n\n§YDuring the civil war in Austria in February 1934, he flew the Bundesheer's only armed combat mission§! with an aircraft against the Goethehof in Vienna-Kaisermühlen, although it is unclear in what form this took place or what effects it had.

austrianawakening.84.desc:0 "The Austrian nation, in its current federal structure, has been conceived as a compromise solution between the reactionary right-wing CS and the progressive left-wing SDAP in 1919/1920. The SDAP knew it would only dominante Red Vienna whereas the CS would hold the rural lands firmly, therefore the SDAP naturally preferred a centralized structure; and the CS, coming to the same conclusion, demanded a federal nation in order to remain in power. This conflict of interest has given way to our current federal nation with a centralized legislation in Vienna. Now, the days of the SP playing merely the role of tame opposition are finally in the past and we could, in theory, go after our model state that centralizes every branch of jurisdication, legislation and executive to the working class' decisions residing in Vienna. This, however, would come at the expense of not just popularity but the genuinenly beneficial ability of federal states to enact centralized law on their accord and to their own indivdual capabilities, preventing the logistical problem that is financing, governing and administrating nine different regions within Austria. Naturally, a centralized state would in turn grant us a much tighter hold over politicla development in the entire nation. What to do?"

Jansa has brought forward the idea to not defend Austrias borders itself in case of war, but rather see Austria as an defensive realm, retreating to specific points to gain an stratecic advantage over the enemy. Fortifcations should be constructed along these key positions, especially in lower Austria where it is likely for the German Army to try and rush towards Wien. The 116 Million Schilling spent upon the defense of Austria in a year is to be increased to 250 Million Schilling until 1940, modernizing the Bundesheer and constructing another layer of defensives in the Alps."

His military clothing was quickly stained by blood, and he could feel his strengh leaving his body. As he collapsed on his knees and finally feel to the muddy ground, his view began to become dizzy. It was, as if his life past by in quick time: He saw his parents; his youth in Wien and the drilling in the Barracks in Linz...\nHe shook his head slightly in an attempt to regain consciousness, but he knew, he would bleed out and his time would be over. The sound of the rain, the gunfire and the screams of the Soldiers; he could hear nothing of it. As he turned his head slowly to his left; he saw a snail slowly moving on the ground.

The most important lesson was that future wars will benefit the defendant massively, to the point where no well-established trench can be overcome by infantry alone. What proved succesful however was the usage of highly trained, well-equipped breecher units – the so-called Sturmtruppen – that used flamethrowers and automatic weaponry to create an opening which could sabotage the whole defensive line. Hence, \n\n1. Future soldiers must be equipped and trained to be able to breech and suppress on their own via automatic fire, necessitating a revision in issuing automatic rifles as soon as possible. \n\n2. No infantry, not even Sturmtruppen, will ever be able to reliably take offensive positions without combined arms fire by artillery and air strikes, potentially even mechanical units. Austria's soldiers must be trained to work as a cohesive union that know how to effectively communicate and precisely call in more flexible artillery support opposed to the largely static, separated artillery from the Great War. \n\n3. Of particular note was the surprising efficiency of Austrian soldiers in mountainous territory, irrespective if it was the Alpine front against the Italians or fighting the Russians in the carpathian mountains, storming the heavily fortified Zwinin; people recruited from the Alps have had a natural understanding of the treachery of mountainous terraine, which gave them an edge over enemies who weren't as familiar. Our army has to be trained to fight in every landscape our country has to offer; a broad understanding of and experience with mountain, rural, urban, forrest, swamp and any other warfare ensures our boys will be utilizing everything they can to our advantage, from the shrapnell-effect of artillery detonating on carst to blowing up river gates to flood enemy entrenchments. \n\nAll of these any many, many more refinements will constitute the successor of the old army.

Our people would see us as a natural part of the German nation, the Greater German Reich of Großdeutschland in fact, which could become our destiny.

The german Fürher stated that the entire history of Austria would be nothing but a story of uninterrupted high treason. Contining he harshly critized the austrian political situation and claimed it as a "lawless" province and its "un-german" character. Forcing himself calm Schuschnigg eventually merely replied "My opinion on these questions differs basically from yours." Knowing it was more then counter productive to engage in a debate with Hitler, he left it at that. \n\nContinuing Hitler stated that "I have only have to give an order and all your ridiculous defences will be blown to bits.

Ullrich Ribbentropp and Franz von Papen, German minister of foreign affairs and ambassador in Vienna respectively, invite the Austrian chancellor to enjoy the serenity of the Alpine panorama on their balcony. After sharing a cigar and exchanging warm yet hollow pleasantries, the pair presents Schuschnigg a document of Hitler's demands, and, as the crestfallen Austrian soon must realize, it goes much further beyond than what he was prepared to concede to Germany; reinstate the NDSAP. Appoint three National Socialists to the ministry of internal affairs, war and finances respectively – thus relinquishing control over Austrian administration, police force and military coordination to the Nazis. And, as the final nail in the coffin, the document is not a simple list, it is a very timed ultimatum. If Schuschnigg does not sign it 'right here, right now, without any ammendments or changes to it', the Wehrmacht will march east. Schuschnigg explains that, while willing to sign, he cannot guaranee the ratification of such an act in such a miniscule timeframe. Hitler sees reason and concedes him three days to implement his demands. Lest Austria faces war. Schuschnigg politely declined the invitation for a souper and withdrew. Alone but for Von Papen, who accompanied him unto the border. Lost in thought. Defeated."

The integration is regulated by the Front Militia Act. Accordingly, the Frontmiliz consists of the "Allgemeine Miliz", general militia, (hunter and stand militia) and Sondermiliz, special militias, (motor, air raid, aviation, railway, university, postal and telegraph militia and company militias). Officers from the Bundesheer will now be assigned to their command staff as militia cadres. Physically and mentally fit male Austrian citizens between the ages of 18 and 60 who have knowledge of the German language and are members of the Fatherland Front can join the militia, tho service itself will remain completely voluntary. \n\nThe Federal Chancellor can order the deployment of the militia for border protection, the protection of constitutional institutions, the maintenance of internal order and security and to provide assistance in “natural events” or “accidents of an extraordinary extent”. With this increase of their operational capabilites may be strengthening home defence and the VF itself against the Nazi threat, the reality is that still the Fronmiliz can only be used for border and spatial protection and for security tasks, as it is not prepared for military operations due to a lack of joint exercises with the Bundesheer, not to even mention poor equipment. \nThis must be our next priority; to make Bundesheer and Frontmiliz used to and effective with working and operating together."

'The first and final addressing point of today without any addditional redundancy nor debate shall be – Austria!', the chancellor opens his speech. 'After the humiliating conference in Berchtesgarden, the peace between the two German states has been secured once and for all', he then proclaims.

The world would be shaken in it's very foundation if treaties between national leaders had turned into nothing but deceptive trickery, merely a tool to gain the upper hand in easing the journey that is triumphing over the other pary.' Schuschnigg proceeds to explain the results of the meeting with Hitler while emphasising that the Austrian government, people and country, loyally remain aligned to the VF policy; 'Until here and no step further! Austria is alive and well, and will not voluntarily abdicate to Germany.' – 'The spirit of the 1934 constitution remains entrenched in the government' – a clear message to Austrian Nazis; neither nationalism nor socialism in Austria, but patriotism!

We shall not relinquish our government to the Germans, we shall not invite them to our lands, we shall not seek friendly relationships by dictate and we shall not bow before their regime, however mighty it may be, for surrendering any inch will go a mile for the Germans to usurp our nation and integrate it into their Reich. This shall never happen. \n\nSchuschnigg has called in an emergency meeting of the government to discuss the necessary steps to take for rallying the nation against the proposal. The public perception of Austrians being nothing more than or different from Germans – itself a remnant of the thousand years spent in the HRE – is still largely popular and accepted. If we are to sustain our independence and avoid that Brother fights Brother in the wildfire of war, we must hammer out the notion.

And it is precisely the fact that the Austrians showed their teeth in such a readiness to defend their homes, even, or perhaps especially, when they're not of imperative strategical importance that left no doubt in anybody's minds that resistance against German agression would not just happen, it would also be bloody and fierce. The pro-Nazi sympathisers people feared would revolt remainedd quiet and in disguise, not challenging the VF's authority. And with German troops reportedly being withdrawn again back into the lowlands of the Reich, the threat of a forceful Anschluss seems averted. Though the matter of Austrian independence certainly isn't yet settled, this historical event nonetheless proves that the people who, barely 20 years ago, were demanding to be integrated into the powerful patron to their northwest, have found their own sense of nationality and belonging."

With tensions and threats to Austrian independence rising, the organisation has expaned and became much more distinctively militaristic over time, even molding its originially culturally intended duties toward a militarist youth. \n\nAs opposing illegal youth organisation, such as the Revolutionäre Sozialistische Jugend, became significantly less popular in the past months, thanks to VF influence, the Jungvolk has become the dominant presence among all of Austria´s Bundesländer, recruiting youngsters in large numbers. Its increasing size also grows its own influence, and we could lend a hand in getting every youth underneath the umbrella that is the Jungvolk; or seek to keep it a more restricted, disciplined organization which can focus to further support the more promising members on an individual rather than nation-wide basis."

austrianawakening.459.desc:0 "After the collapse of Austria-Hungary in 1918, the newly founded state of German Austria claimed, among other things, the German-speaking part of western Hungary for itself. In the Treaty of St. Germain concluded between Austria and the victorious powers of the Great War, the area was awarded to Austria in 1919; Hungary had to agree to cede it in the Treaty of Trianon in 1920. After the establishment of the short-lived Republic of Lajtabánság under the leadership of the irregular commander Pál Prónay in October 1921, the area was occupied by the Austrian army the following month and officially handed over from Hungary to Austria on December 5, 1921. The attitude of the German-speaking settlers in western Hungary to the annexation to Austria was inconsistent for economic reasons. After violent protests from Hungary, a referendum was held in December 1921 for Ödenburg (Sopron in Hungarian), which was intended to be the capital of the new federal state, and its surroundings, which led to Ödenburg remaining part of Hungary. The overall result of the referendum was a clear two-thirds majority in favor of remaining part of Hungary, as numerous voters were brought in from the interior of the country. The communities around Ödenburg voted for Austria; The majority of the population in the city of Ödenburg voted to remain part of Hungary. In January 1923 the municipality of Schandorf and the town of Luising were added to Austria, and in March the towns of Rattersdorf and Liebing followed suit. In return, Olmond and Prostrum were returned to Hungary in March 1923. \n\nFollowing these developments thus far no further changes on our Eastern border have happend since and the region of Burgenland celebrates today its 15th anniversary as an austrian state, as the country's admission to Austria was regulated in the Federal Constitutional Law on the status of Burgenland as an independent and equal state in the federal government and on its provisional establishment of January 25, 1921. \n\nOf course, the large economic and social issues the region have are still troubling and will need to be adressed."

Instead, the Kaiserreich proposes a treaty of mutual friendship and army inspections to allow both powers to keep tabs on each other's military capabilities and current formations.

The oldest son of the last Austrian Emperor, Otto von Habsburg-Lothringen, now Kaiser Franz Joseph II., rode, in a ceremonial act, the entire distance from the westernmost reach of Austria to the heart of Vienna in one go, being followed by an attaché of loyalists, former imperial servants and high-ranking officials, many of which, such as Graf Starhemberg, were seen riding motor-carriages along the way. Not Franz Joseph, however. The young Emperor remained steadfast and rode day and night until Vienna, where, arriving in the early morning, he was greated by a tremendous crowd of people cheering and saluting him. Entering the Cathedral of St. Stephan, he kneeled before the altar as a fanfare and chorus sang Hallelujah!, and shortly thereafter received the Rudolfskrone, which thus far had never been used for a coronation of an Emperor, and the Church's blessing. Franz Joseph II. thanked the Divine Lord and the Austrian people and swore to do everything in his royal powers to govern his people through the best and worst of times. His unexpected, clearly improvised yet very heartfelt oath of loyalty to Austria may become a new tradition for future monarchs, a contemporary remarked. International reaction has yet to be determined, however it is clear that this coronation will inevitably cause several diplomatic crises; but it is the will of the Austrian people, and it seems the return to monarchy is nothing international protest, raging Führers or strongly worded letters of royal contempt could prevent now."

austrianawakening.502.desc:0 "Amidst the outbreak of the Brothers War, the Austrian air defences were taken by surprise and shock by the German Luftwaffe which immediately flew a bombing run over Vienna. The old city was thankfully spared of an ensuing fire, but nevertheless a considerable amount of buildings got demolished, burrying hundreds of unsuspecting Austrians beneath the debris. The death toll is at least two-thousand people. It is clear that the practices foreshadowed in the Spanish civil war will soon threaten every major European city like such.

While we struck a deal with the Führer back then, to keep the army we already had as a unified army group under the control of the German OKW, they have also integrated many of our Austrian troops into the SS divisons, citing Austrian 'eastern competency'; a fact we can now put to good use, as many Austrians have ranked up quite highly by now and we do have promising contacts that could ... dispose of the German OKW officials commanding our Austrian army group, not too dissimiliar of how we could take control over the Nibelungenwerke. It is a matter of initiative to suggest the Führer to appoint an Austrian of our choosing to control our army group, bringing them back into our own national hands again, although not yet disconnected from the German Wehrmacht. This also poses a question: should we, a potentially provocative gesture, return to our old Austrian uniforms or keep the unified German Wehrmacht apparel, which reduces the public perception of our autonomity?"

It is completely unacceptable that our hopelessly outdated army continues lacking behind and thusly shedding a negative light on the German military as a whole. No man-portable Panzerabwehr? Non-interchangeable ammunition between Wehrmacht and Bundesheer? A wild mix of outdated italian tankettes and experimental dead-ends of autonomous tank designs? The current state of our Korps is a disgrace and our soldiers are better off joining the mighty Wehrmacht opposed to our obsolite Spielzeugmacht. \n\nStill, this does not mean the Ostmark forces cannot catch up at all. After all, reforming after an existing German template will be a much briefer process than a fully autonomous, tenative approach and, with a bit of goodwill from the Führer, we should be able to overcome our technical drawbacks in swift a swift manner to finally create an army worthy of the name Deutsche Wehrmacht."

Thus far however, this is essentially all the Reich has done, and there are for now no signs of further, more extreme direct consequences for us. The new unrest in the streets is still largely limited in size and areas so that local police is capable of handling it, without the need of support from the Frontmilizen or even the Bundesheer."

No doubt, much had been accomplished under Schihlwasky´s dictatorship and almost the entire political spectrum respects or atleast regocnizes this. \n\nThere are many ways in which Schihlwasky now can leave Austria with; the first would be a return of power to the Vaterländische Front and its Staatsrat, which however has become quite unpopular and almost irrelevant during the later stages of the War. Alternatively, a return to a more democratic system, still authoritarian in character, could be made as to find compromise between the factions, the past and the future. \n\nUltimately it is up to Ritter von Bahnbrück to decide; the last call made with the emergency powers as such will be:"

The Brits want [Get.Leader] to essentially break with the authoritarian Ständestaat and re-instate free elections.

 AUS_support_weapons_desc:0 "The Maschinengewehr (Schwarzlose) M. 7, also known as the Schwarzlose MG, is a medium machine-gun, used as a standard issue firearm in the Austro-Hungarian Army throughout World War I. It was utilized by the Dutch, Greek and Hungarian armies during World War II. It was routinely issued to Italian colonial troops, alongside the Mannlicher M1895 rifle."
 AUS_support_weapons2:0 "MG 34"
 AUS_support_weapons2_desc:0 "The versatile MG 34 was arguably the most advanced machine gun in the world at the time of its deployment. Its combination of exceptional mobility – being light enough to be carried by one man – and high rate of fire (of up to 900 rounds per minute) was unmatched."
 AUS_support_weapons3:0 "MG 42"
 AUS_support_weapons3_desc:0 "Intended to replace the earlier MG 34, the MG 42 has a proven record of reliability, durability, simplicity, and ease of operation, but is most notable for its ability to produce a high volume of suppressive fire. The MG 42 had one of the highest average cyclic rates of any single-barreled man-portable machine gun: between 1,200 and 1,500 rpm, resulting in a distinctive muzzle report compared to the sound of a power saw or tearing linoleum."
 AUS_support_weapons4:0 "MG 45"
 AUS_support_weapons4_desc:0 "The MG 45 differed from the MG 42 in that it did not completely lock its breech before firing, increasing its rate of fire and simplifying its construction. In 1945, the material shortages of the Third Reich led to the development of a newer version of the MG 42, the MG 45 (or MG 42V). The tested MG 45/42V fired 120,000 rounds in succession at a rate of fire around 1,350 rounds per minute."
