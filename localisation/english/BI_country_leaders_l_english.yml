 #Austria-Hungary
 POLITICS_FRANZ_JOSEPH_DESC:0 "Franz Joseph looms large in the historical consciousness of posterity. a symbol of the Monarchy who was beyond criticism. Even today, Franz Joseph is regarded as the very epitome of the emperor in the successor states of the Monarchy. His personality developed in unique and difficult circumstances: from his earliest youth it was impressed up on him that he had been chosen as emperor, an office that was to be served with humility. His mental isolation was reinforced by court ceremonial, which elevated his imperial majesty to an almost religious level. Franz Joseph was wholly imbued with the concept of his divine mission as emperor. In December 1848, Franz Joseph's uncle Emperor Ferdinand abdicated the throne at Olomouc, as part of Minister President Felix zu Schwarzenberg's plan to end the Revolutions of 1848 in Hungary. Franz Joseph then acceded to the throne. Largely considered to be a reactionary, he spent his early reign resisting constitutionalism in his domains. The Austrian Empire was forced to cede its influence over Tuscany and most of its claim to Lombardy-Venetia to the Kingdom of Sardinia, following the Second Italian War of Independence in 1859 and the Third Italian War of Independence in 1866. Franz Joseph is troubled by nationalism during his entire reign. He concluded the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, which granted greater autonomy to Hungary and transformed the Austrian Empire into the Dual Monarchy of Austria-Hungary. He rules peacefully for now, but personally suffered the tragedies of the execution of his brother Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico in 1867, the suicide of his son Crown Prince Rudolf in 1889 and the assassination of his wife Empress Elisabeth in 1898. Yet even after all this he is known to many as a person of integrity and decency, Franz Joseph is variously described by people around him as stoic or even unfeeling in his reaction to the numerous political and military defeats he suffered as ruler, which he took as personal setbacks."

He entered the Salvadoran army at a very young age, where he participated in the 1906 war with Guatemala, rising to brigadier general in 1919. Martínez came to power in 1931 during a tumultuous year of political maneuvering. He emerged as the vice president of Arturo Araujo, a wealthy landowner with reformist aspirations. However, after winning the elections, Araujo proved to be a weak ruler, unable to deal with the serious problems arising from the world depression, especially the depressed price of coffee, the country's main export. In December 1931, a group of young army officers expelled Araujo in a military coup. Martínez was arrested, although the junior officers later installed him as president since, as vice president, he was next in line. The situation was changed by the outbreak of an agrarian revolt in which disgruntled peasants tried to seize the land, breaking out throughout the interior of the nation. The uprising alarmed the landowners and forced them to seek military support. In the process they turned to General Martínez, who saw his opportunity and mercilessly crushed the revolt. Martínez was able to consolidate his position with his new support from the oligarchy and carefully orchestrated his own election. In subsequent years, Martínez has twice extended his mandate. El Salvador was essentially bankrupt during the 1930s, and since this left little money for government projects, Martínez's efforts were based on minimal spending. The general has maintained a tight personal control over the nation, with regime becoming more oppressive in the past few years."

The Victorian Era is currently a period of industrial, political, scientific, and military change within the United Kingdom, and its marked by a great expansion of the British Empire. In 1876, the British Parliament voted to grant her the additional title of Empress of India. Her mother was extremely protective, and Victoria was raised largely isolated from other children under the so-called 'Kensington System', an elaborate set of rules and protocols devised by the Duchess and her ambitious and domineering comptroller, Sir John Conroy, who was rumoured to be the Duchess's lover. Victoria married her first cousin Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha in 1840. Their children married into royal and noble families across the continent, earning Victoria the sobriquet 'The Grandmother of Europe' and spreading haemophilia in European royalty. Albert became an important political adviser as well as the Queen's companion, replacing Viscount Melbourne as the dominant influential figure in the first half of her life. Victoria's mother was evicted from the palace, to Ingestre House in Belgrave Square. After the death of Victoria's aunt, Princess Augusta, in 1840, Victoria's mother was given both Clarence and Frogmore Houses. Through Albert's mediation, relations between mother and daughter slowly improved. After Albert's death in 1861, Victoria plunged into deep mourning and avoided public appearances. As a result of her seclusion, republicanism in the United Kingdom temporarily gained strength, but in the latter half of her reign, her popularity recovered.

The result of the elections ended up with him as the most voted candidate. However, President Luis Gutiérrez, dissatisfied with the results and determined to remain in power, declared martial law and himself as a dictator to prolong his presidency. Gutiérrez's decision caused the outbreak of a new civil war, which annulled the chances of Carías Andino to rise to power. At that time the situation became chaotic, but normalcy was restored after a coup. Many years later, in October 1932, new elections were held, winner being Carías Andino. He has held the presidency of the country since 1933, and after carrying out successive constitutional reforms, he has managed to prolong his mandate.

Alexander III argued that Nicholas was not mature enough to take on serious responsibilities, to which Witte replied that if Nicholas was not introduced to state affairs, he would never be ready to understand them. Alexander's assumptions that he would live a long life and had years to prepare Nicholas for becoming Tsar proved wrong, as by 1894, Alexander's health was failing. On 26 May 1896, Nicholas's formal coronation as Tsar was held in Uspensky Cathedral located within the Kremlin. Nicholas always believed God chose him to be the tsar and therefore the decisions of the tsar reflected the will of God and could not be disputed. He was convinced that the simple people of Russia understood this and loved him, as demonstrated by the display of affection he perceived when he made public appearances.

 POLITICS_ELEAZAR_LOPEZ_CONTRERAS_DESC:0 "Eleazar López Contreras is a Venezuelan military and politician, President of the Republic since 1936. His military career was developed under important caudillos, under whose command he defended the country against the naval blockade of 1902. The future president held various administrative positions during the dictatorship of Juan Vicente Gómez (1908-1935). In 1919 he was appointed Director of War, a position from which he favored the implementation of Military Aviation. In 1924 he served as head of the Venezuelan military delegation in Peru. Between 1928 and 1929 he served as Chief of the Caracas Garrison. Despite faithfully serving the Gómez regime, Eleazar López Contreras did not support his repressive measures during the uprisings of 1928 and 1929 and asked to be transferred to Táchira. He then returned to Maracay, and Juan Vicente Gómez appointed him interim Chief of the Army General Staff (1930) and Minister of War and Navy (1931-1935), a position from which he unified and modernized these bodies. When President Juan Vicente Gómez died (December 17, 1935) there were numerous revolts that López Contreras suppressed, taking control of the situation. Appointed provisional president by the Council of Ministers (1935), the following year the election was ratified, holding the position of president ever since."
