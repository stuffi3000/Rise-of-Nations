### EVENTS

mal.1.t:0 "The Origin of Ethnic Conflict"
mal.1.d:0 "The British started to control Malaya since the Pangkor Treaty of 1874. They indirectly rule those sultanates through the residential system, and protect the rights and interests of the aborigines. On the other hand, many chinese and indian people immigrated to Malaya since the 19th century. The British ruler neglected the interest of these immigrants and maintain the pro-Malay policy. \n\nMoreover, the colonial government deliberately separated the immigrants from the locals to avoid assimilation between them. This policy stirs up dissension among the Malays, the Chinese and the Indian. It may cause an ethnic conflict in the future."
mal.1.a:0 "We only care about commercial profit."
mal.2.t:0 "Operation Matador"
mal.2.d:0 "Major-General William Dobbie, Officer Commanding Malaya, looked at Malaya's defences and reported that during the monsoon season, from October to March, landings could be made by an enemy on the east coast and bases could be established in Siam. He predicted that landings could be made at Songkhla and Pattani in Siam, and Kota Bharu in Malaya. He recommended a plan that we should implement a pre-emptive strike into Siam. We will send forces to intercept them just over the border in Siam, long enough for the main force to assemble and attack. \n\nHowever, there were several problems with the plan. Firstly, Siam is a neutral country. Secondly, the lack of troops deployed in Malaya to implement the operation."
mal.2.a:0 "We will plan another operation."
mal.3.t:0 "Operation Krohcol"
mal.3.d:0 "London objected to implement Operation Matador. We have planned the Operation Krohcol as an alternative to Matador. Three ad hoc columns were put together to harass and delay the Japanese advance from their beachheads at Songkhla and Pattani. Krohcol was the most important of the three. It was tasked with the destruction of the feature known as the Ledge. \n\n Destruction of the Ledge would effectively block the road from Pattani thereby ensuring the security of 11th Indian Infantry Division's line of communication and retreat."
mal.3.a:0 "Attack!"

The British Military Administration suggest a plan to improve administrative efficiency in Malaya that these colonies will be combined under one administration. A Malayan Union is formed. \n\nSir Harold MacMichael was assigned the task of gathering the Malay state rulers' approval for the Union. We heard that those sultans intend to cooperate with the Japanese. Therefore, if they don't agree the formation of the union, they will be dethroned."
mal.4.a:0 "We will directly rule these states."
mal.6.t:0 "Protest against the Malayan Union"
mal.6.d:0 "The Malays generally opposed the creation of the Union. The opposition was due to the methods Sir Harold MacMichael used to acquire the Sultans' approval, the reduction of the Sultans' powers, and granting of citizenship to immigrants. The United Malays National Organisation(UMNO), a Malay political association formed by Onn Jaafar, led the opposition against the Malayan Union. They utilised civil disobedience as a means of protest by refusing to attend the installation ceremonies of the British governors. \n\nThey had also refused to participate in the meetings of the Advisory Councils, hence Malay participation in the government bureaucracy and the political process had totally stopped."
mal.6.a:0 "Maybe we should accept their opinion."
mal.7.t:0 "Federation of Malaya"
mal.7.d:0 "The Federation of Malaya Agreement was formulated by the British–Malay Pleno Conference and was signed at King House by the Malay rulers, and by Sir Edward Gent as the representative of the British government. The Federation includes 11 states and restore the symbolic positions of the rulers of the Malay states, but it excludes Singapore."
mal.7.a:0 "We have compromised."
mal.8.t:0 "Onn Jaafar's Resignation"
mal.8.d:0 "Onn became increasingly disgusted with what he considered to be UMNO's race based communalist policies. He called for party membership to be opened to all Malayans, and for UMNO to be renamed as the United Malayans National Organisation. But most of leaders of UMNO neglected his recommendations. Finally, he choose to leave the party. Tunku Abdul Rahman become the next chairman of UMNO."
mal.8.a:0 "We repect his thoughts."
MAL_onn_jaafar_leave_tt:0 "Tunku Abdul Rahman become the leader of UNMO."
mal.9.t:0 "Ketuanan Melayu"
mal.9.d:0 "Since the 15th century, the Chinese has immigrated to Malaya. They gradually became the majority of the main cities, and threatened the interests of the Malays. This should not be continued because we are the proper owner of this land. The Malays is superior to those immigrants!"
mal.9.a:0 "We will be firmly established Malay dominance."
mal.9.b:0 "We should treat the immigrants equally."
mal.10.t:0 "Race Riots in Singapore"
mal.10.d:0 "A riot broke out during the Malay procession marking the birthday of the Islamic prophet Muhammad! There are many muslim organisations participated in the rally. They formed a celebratory procession from the Padang to Saint Andrews Road,  and eventually to Geylang. Suddenly, A huge group of Chinese threw rocks and bottles at the Malays during the procession. They goaded by ultra-nationalists of Singapore United Malays National Organisation, the Islamic religious procession quickly turned violent. \n\nThe government declared a curfew to restore order. In the riot, many people were killed and injured. There was significant damage to property and vehicles as well."
mal.10.a:0 "We must do something to restore peace."
mal.11.t:0 "Independence of Malaysia"

mal.11.a:0 "Excellent."
MAL_independence_of_malaysia_tt:0 "Malaysia is formed."

mal.12.t:0 "Rise of Malay Nationalism"
mal.12.d:0 "The colonial government decided to grant those immigrants equal rights. They broke the traditional ruling method, and not recognise Malay supremacy. The decision seems to lead to more Malays support for nationalism. Kesatuan Melayu Muda, a radical nationalist political organization, gain a lot of Malay people support for the independence of Malaya. \n\nOriginally, most of the Malays strongly support the British rule. But now they lost confidence in the colonial rule because the pro-Malay policy will not be continued."
mal.12.a:0 "Maybe we should let go."

mal.13.t:0 "Uncoordinated Society"
mal.13.d:0 "Chinese immigrants became the majority of the main cities. They are wealthy and intelligent. They accounted for a large proportion in the population. But most of the Malays lived in rural areas, and were the grassroots in our country. Although now we controlled the government, the Chinese don't want to cooperate with us. We believe that most of Chinese political organizations were manipulated by the Chinese government. We have not enough power to tame them."
mal.13.a:0 "Curse them!"

mal.14.t:0 "Selangor Succession Dispute"
mal.14.d:0 "Sultan Alaeddin Sulaiman Shah had many children, his first three sons in chronological order being Tengku Musa Eddin, Tengku Badar Shah and Tengku Alam Shah. In 1903, Tunku Musa Eddin had been made Tengku Mahkota and was promoted to Raja Muda or heir apparent in 1920. However, at the instigation of the British Resident, Theodore Samuel Adams, Tengku Musa Eddin was dismissed as Raja Muda in 1934 for alleged "misbehaviour". Adams had accused Tengku Musa Eddin as a spendthrift and wastrel with a penchant for gambling.Tengku Alam Shah was instead proclaimed Raja Muda or heir to the throne over the head of his other half-brother. \n\nHowever, many Malays in Selangor believed the real reason for Tengku Musa Eddin's dismissal was his refusal to follow Adam's orders. Now the appointment occurred."
mal.14.a:0 "They must follow our recommendation."
MAL_selangor_succession_dispute_tt:0 "\nMost of the Malay people §Yare not satisfied§! with this appointment."

mal.15.t:0 "Far East Defense Strategy"
mal.15.d:0 "In 1920, the Admiralty issued War Memorandum (Eastern) 1920, a series of instructions in the event of a war with Japan. In it, the defence of Singapore was described as "absolutely essential". The strategy was presented to the Dominions at the 1923 Imperial Conference. The memorandum divided a war with Japan into three phases. In the first phase, the garrison of Singapore would defend the fortress while the fleet made its way from home waters to Singapore. Next, the fleet would sail from Singapore and relieve or recapture Hong Kong. The final phase would see the fleet blockade Japan and force it to accept terms. \n\nHowever, due to lack of support for reinforcing Far East defense, we will not be able to implement the second phase."
mal.15.a:0 "Far East defense was ignored..."
MAL_rescue_hong_kong_tt:0 "\nWe §Ywill not be able§! to implement the second phase of the Far East defense strategy."

mal.16.t:0 "Bombing of Singapore"
mal.16.d:0 "The war broke out! The Japanese assigned seventeen G3M Nell bombers to attack Singapore. We detected their formation at a radar station in Mersing. Three Brewster Buffalo fighters of No. 453 Squadron RAAF were on standby at RAF Sembawang. But we denied the request from the Flight Lieutenant Tim Vigors asked to scramble and intercept the Japanese bombers because we feared that the anti-aircraft batteries would fire on the friendly fighters, despite Vigors being an experienced night fighter in the Battle of Britain."
mal.16.a:0 "The war began."

mal.17.t:0 "Battle of Kuala Lumpur"
mal.17.d:0 "The northern part of Malaya, including Perlis, Kedah, Kelantan, Terengganu and Penang had fallen into Japanese hands. After the Battle of Slim River, the Japanese troops' next military objective was Kuala Lumpur. We decided to abandon Selangor and Negeri Sembilan to the Japanese, and our forces began a quick retreat to Johor then to Singapore. The city, now abandoned, quickly descended into a state of anarchy and chaos. Looting was widespread. The Japanese troops entered Kuala Lumpur without much resistance, besides small skirmishes.

We were forced to retreat towards Johor Bahru; however, following a further series of bombings by the Japanese, , we retreated to Singapore and blew up the causeway the following day as a final attempt to stop the Japanese advancement in British Malaya. The Japanese then used the Sultan's residence of Bukit Serene Palace located in the town as their main temporary base for their future initial plans to conquest Singapore while waiting to reconnect the causeway. They chose the palace as their main base because they already knew the British would not dare to attack it as this would harm their close relationship with Johor."

Bicycles allowed quiet and flexible transport of thousands of troops who were then able to surprise and confuse the defenders. It also made few demands on the Japanese war machine, needing neither trucks, nor ships to transport them, nor precious petroleum. Using bicycles, the Japanese troops were able to move faster than the withdrawing Allied Forces, often successfully cutting off our retreat."

 ### MAL - BRITISH MALAYA NAVAL EQUIP ### 
 MAL_submarine_1:0 "L Class"
 MAL_submarine_1_desc:0 "The L-class were medium sized boats originally planned under the Emergency War Program as an improved version of the previous submarine classes. They were built in the late stages of World War I and were equipped with new, larger 21 in. torpedoes. They served until the beginning of World War II when they were mostly used for secondary and training duties."
 MAL_submarine_2:0 "T Class"
 MAL_submarine_2_desc:0 "The T-class or Triton-class boats were designed to replace the O, P, and R class large submarines. They were moderately large submarines with long range well-suited for the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. These boats were well-armed, stable platforms and were used extensively during the conflict, as 25 percent of the constructed boats were lost during the war."
 MAL_submarine_3:0 "U Class"
 MAL_submarine_3_desc:0 "The U class were small-sized submarines built under the War Emergency 1940 and 1941 Programs. Originally designed as training submarines as the war broke out, the design changed, allowing these submarines to prove useful in the confined waters of the North Sea and the Mediterranean. Due to their smaller size, their range and the weaponry were limited. Three subclasses made up the class: Undine, Umpire and Uproar."
 MAL_submarine_4:0 "V Class"
 MAL_submarine_4_desc:0 "The V-class or Vampire-class submarines were based on the previous U-class smaller sized boats. They were larger but still relatively small, with better seagoing ability but limited operational range and weaponry."
 MAL_destroyer_1:0 "V/W Class"
 MAL_destroyer_1_desc:0 "These destroyers included the Admirality and Thornycroft V and W classes. They were built under the War Emergency Program. They were the ultimate evolution of British destroyer design during the First World War, embodying the improvements of their predecessors as well as new technological advances. Large numbers of these ships were built during the late stages of WWI and became the backbone of the Royal Navy's destroyer flotillas afterwards. Beginning in the 1930s, they were placed into reserve fleets, used eventually relegated to convoy escort duties. They were adequately-armed, fast vessels with good range."
 MAL_destroyer_2:0 "G/H/I Class"
 MAL_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The G, H, and I class destroyers were ordered as part of the 1933 and 1934 Naval Construction Programs. They were generally repeats of the preceding F class, with a slight reduction in size. Armament in the G and H classes were the same as in the F class, with both using on the 4.7 in. guns. These ships had long range, were adequately armed, and had a strong torpedo complement. They were used extensively during the war and suffered numerous losses."
 MAL_destroyer_3:0 "J/K/N Class"
 MAL_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The J, K, and N classes were similar to the earlier Tribal class but rather than emphasizing gun armament, the designers returned to a more standard heavy torpedo and lighter gun setup. The ships were modified throughout their wartime service. Upgrades included improved anti-aircraft guns and radar. They were fast, long-ranged and well-armed vessels ideal for fleet escorts."
 MAL_destroyer_4:0 "Battle Class"
 MAL_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Battle class destroyers built upon the evolution of British destroyers used throughout the war. The ships were ordered as part of the 1942 and 1943 Naval Programs. They were well-armed in terms of both their guns and their torpedoes. Their AA armament ASW capabilities, speed, and range made them versatile vessels. Their late introduction to the war led to a minimal contribution."
 MAL_light_cruiser_1:0 "C Class"
 MAL_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "C-class light cruisers were a group of twenty-eight light cruisers of the Royal Navy. They were built before and during the First World War for the rough conditions of the North Sea. They proved to be rugged and capable vessels despite being somewhat small and cramped. Their armament was more than satisfactory, as they carried enough 6 in. guns to fight enemy surface targets and a heavy torpedo load to finish off enemy vessels and convoys. They saw extensive use during WWI and participated in many surface actions. Only a limited number of the vessels survived the scrap head to WWI. Only the Caledon, Ceres, and Carlisle subclasses were in service by the mid 1930's."
 MAL_light_cruiser_2:0 "Southampton Class"
 MAL_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Southampton-class light cruisers were a subclass of the Town-class cruisers and were designed to counter the Japanese Mogami-class cruisers. These vessels were well-armored, had good speed and range, and carried a formidable armament of twelve 6 in. guns in four triple turrets. They were the basis for many of the subsequent RN wartime light cruiser designs."
 MAL_light_cruiser_3:0 "Crown Colony Class"
 MAL_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Crown Colony-class light cruisers were improved versions of the earlier Town class but with a simplified design to speed up construction and reduce costs. The ships carried the same guns as their predecessors, four triple turrets housing 6 in. guns. They were similarly armored but because of their smaller engines, their range was somewhat reduced. The type included two subclasses: Fiji and Ceylon."
 MAL_light_cruiser_4:0 "Minotaur Class"
 MAL_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "Also known as the Swiftsure class, these cruisers were designed as a modified version of the Crown Colony class, incorporating war modifications that were authorized in 1941. They had a longer operational range and more numerous AA weaponry than the Crown Colony class, while the main armament was reduced to three triple turrets. Built too late to affect the outcome of the war, most of the ordered vessels were cancelled afterwards. "
 MAL_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Hawkins Class"
 MAL_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Hawkins-class cruisers were the first heavy cruisers in the world. They were based on the earlier Town-class light cruisers, particularly the Birmingham subclass, but equipped with 7.5 in. guns and a thicker armor belt. They were designed to fight the large convoy raiders of Germany. They were well-armed, had reasonable speed and range, and good protection. Altogether, five ships were commissioned but only four were active at the start of WWII."
 MAL_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Surrey Class"
 MAL_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Surrey-class heavy cruisers were proposed under the 1928 Naval Program. They were improved versions of the earlier York-class heavy cruisers. Had they been completed, they would have been equipped with four twin 8 in. gun turrets, heavier armor, and more powerful engines. Two ships were ordered but none were laid down."
 MAL_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Admiral Class"
 MAL_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Admiral-class heavy cruisers (not to be confused with the Admiral-class battlecruisers) were the Royal Navy's last attempt to design and build cruisers armed with 8 in. guns. Design studies started in 1938 and ended in 1941, resulting in various proposals. The final proposals featured new 8 in. guns in triple turrets, a heavy AA armament, thick armor, and good speed. A lack of enemy cruisers and the cost efficiency of these vessels resulted in a focus on building more light cruisers instead."
 MAL_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Churchill Design"
 MAL_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "These ships were proposed by Sir Winston Churchill, Lord of the Admirality, in the early stages of WWII to counter the German Deutschland class big gun cruisers. These vessels would have had 9.2 in. cannons, heavy AA, and strong armor. They were designed to effectively battle the enemy capital ships. The ships were eventually cancelled because of high costs and a lack of demand for a new heavy cruiser. "
 MAL_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Renown Class"
 MAL_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Renown-class battlecruisers were originally laid down as improved versions of the Revenge-class battleships. Their construction was suspended at the outbreak of WWI. Admiral Lord Fisher managed to restart their construction as battlecruisers. These ships were the quintessential battlecruiser. They were well-armed, fast, and maneuverable, but had thinner armor and a shorter operational range. Only two of the original three ships, Repulse and Renown, were completed."
 MAL_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Princess Royal Class"
 MAL_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Princess Royal was a class of hypothetical battlecruisers that were a faster and cheaper version of the King George V-class battleships. These vessels carried a similar but reduced armament for both surface and anti-air combat: two triple 14 in. cannons and six twin 5.25 in. AA guns. Their fast speed and long range would provide the Royal Navy quick strike capabilities and convoy protection, but their limited armor would prove problematic if they had to fight modern battleships."
 MAL_battleship_1:1 "Revenge Class"
 MAL_battleship_1_desc:1 "The Revenge-class battleships were ordered in 1913 as cheap versions of the Queen Elizabeth-class fast dreadnoughts. While similarly armed and armored, their considerably lower speed relegated them to secondary duties during WWII. Of the envisioned 8 ships of the class, only 5 were finished."
 MAL_battleship_2:0 "King George V Class"
 MAL_battleship_2_desc:0 "The King George V-class battleships were the result of the 1922 Washington and 1930 First London Naval Treaties which limited the maximum displacement and gunnery of capital ships. As such, these ships were equipped with smaller-caliber cannons than earlier and even contemporary battleships. Despite the smaller caliber, the ships were adequately armed, carried strong AA weaponry, and had adequate protection. Five ships were ordered and laid down as replacement for the old Queen Elizabeth Class battleships."
 MAL_battleship_3:0 "Lion Class"
 MAL_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Lion-class battleships were the follow-up class to King George V battleships, incorporating many of their features. Six ships were ordered in the 1938 Naval Program to replace the aging Revenge-class battleships but none were finished due to the erupting hostilities. The vessels would have been general similar to the King George-class, but the main armament would be heavier, introducing a new 16 in. cannon. They would also have thicker armor and more powerful engines."
 MAL_battleship_4:0 "Vanguard Class"
 MAL_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Vanguard-class battleship was the last battleship to be built for the Royal Navy. A single ship was ordered but four more were considered for the Pacific theater. Ordered under the 1940 Emergency War Program, construction did not gain a high priority and was finished after the war. The class had a sleek hull, giving excellent stability and seaworthiness. The armament was the same as the Queen Elizabeth and Revenge class battleships, providing considerable firepower. Strong engines and good armor made the vessel fast and well protected."
 MAL_SH_battleship_1:0 "Centurion Class"
 MAL_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Centurion was a class of hypothetical heavy battleships of the Royal Navy built to counter the large vessels of the German and Japanese navies. Large 18 in. guns and thick armor provide the ship with the necessary firepower and protection to battle these vessels. Strong AA armament, long range, and good speed were a necessity to cover the vast seas of the British Empire."
 MAL_SH_battleship_2:0 "Lion II Class"
 MAL_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Lion II class battleships were designed in 1944 as an improved version of the earlier Lion-class battleship. Incorporating wartime lessons, this design was larger and heavier, and if completed, would carry either three or four triple 16 in. guns of the latest type. Thick armor plates protected the ship from any surface or aerial foe. The cost to build these ships, the defeat of enemy navies, and the need for aircraft carriers resulted in the abandonment of the project."
 MAL_carrier_1:0 "Courageous Class"
 MAL_carrier_1_desc:0 "These three aircraft carriers were converted battlecruisers and were the first fleet carriers of the Royal Navy. Their conversion was the result of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 and the work was finished in 1925. They were moderately-armored but well-armed vessels, with long range and good speed, but due to the nature of the conversion their aircraft complement was limited. Nonetheless, they gave the Royal Navy important experience in aircraft carrier construction and fleet air projection."
 MAL_carrier_2:0 "Ark Royal Class"
 MAL_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Ark Royal aircraft carrier was the first such vessel to be built to fit the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty. She was the first ship on which the hangars and flight deck were an integral part of the hull. Designed in 1934, the vessel was well-armored and armed. It carried a large complement of aircraft and had adequate operational range and speed to keep up with the major forces of the Royal Navy."
 MAL_carrier_3:0 "Illustrious Class"
 MAL_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Illustrious class was designed within the restrictions of the Second London Naval Treaty of 1936, which limited carrier size to an upper limit of 23,000 tons. She was the first British carrier to have an armored flight deck, which reduced its air group size. Heavy armor and AA weaponry provided a strong defense for the ships, while powerful engines and a large fuel store gave the ships long operational range. "
 MAL_carrier_4:0 "Implacable Class"
 MAL_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Implacable-class aircraft carriers were ordered under the 1938 Naval Program and were essentially improved versions of the earlier Illustrious class. The war and the shift of priority to smaller vessels for convoy protection duties in the early and middle stages of the war slowed the constriction of these vessels. They were larger vessels able to carry more planes while maintaining thick armor on both the hull and flight deck. More powerful engines gave it greater speed and operational range compared to the Illustrious class."
