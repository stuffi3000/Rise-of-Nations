However, the development of road transport and the decline in the flow of pilgrims due to the global instability have significantly reduced the demand for camels.

    SAU_the_opening_of_the_school_of_princes_desc:0 "The Al Saud family is extremely numerous, with Abdulaziz alone having more than a dozen children. Although the king prefers not to appoint relatives to the highest positions, many descendants of the ruling dynasty will undoubtedly play important roles in state life in the future. The opening of the Princes' School in the Murabba Palace, which is under construction, is intended to make them worthy representatives of the family."
    SAU_strengthening_centralization:0 "Centralize the State"
    SAU_strengthening_centralization_desc:0 "King Abdulaziz has succeeded in the nearly impossible - in subduing and keeping the previously unruly and willful Bedouins in check. But our state is still rather weak. As we expand our power, we should strengthen our state apparatus even more."
    SAU_abolition_of_slavery:0 "Abolish Slavery"
    SAU_abolition_of_slavery_desc:0 "The persistence of slavery has a profoundly negative impact on our nation's international standing. In a transforming kingdom, there is no place for inefficient slave labor. The abolition of slavery will also be favorably received by many of the Ulema, although the tribes and some of the clergy, who consider slavery acceptable because it existed at the time of the Prophet, will view this move negatively."
    SAU_regulate_the_terms_of_the_slave_trade:0 "Regulate the Slave Trade"
    SAU_regulate_the_terms_of_the_slave_trade_desc:0 "A slave trade ban would raise our international standing, but slavery is too deeply rooted in Arabian society and we cannot yet abolish it. Nevertheless, we should regulate the conditions of the slave trade by allowing slaves to enter the country only by land from Yemen, Hadhramaut, Oman, Kuwait and on the condition that the importer is able to prove that the person brought in was a slave in the country of departure and has a health certificate. Slaves must be issued special identification cards with photo cards. In addition, the slave owner should be required to feed and clothe the slaves belonging to him, to treat them gently under threat of forced sale of the slave to another master."
    SAU_construction_of_murabba_palace:0 "Construct the Murabba Palace"
    SAU_construction_of_murabba_palace_desc:0 "Commenced in 1936, the construction of the Murabba Palace, a new family residence and court for the king, is a symbol of the modernization of our kingdom and will confirm Abdulaziz's role as the greatest ruler of Arabia. Designed in the traditional Arab style, it nevertheless brings a number of new technologies to our society: the use of cars as vehicles, electricity and drainage toilets. The first concrete road in the country will connect the palace with the city center."
    SAU_support_for_bedouin_traditions:0 "Support Bedouin Traditions"
    SAU_support_for_bedouin_traditions_desc:0 "Wahhabism has emerged out of the Bedouin and Ulema dissatisfaction with the wealth of urban dwellers. Although the nomads resisted even the appearance of automobiles, the support of Bedouin traditions, the preservation of many remnants of the tribal system, and their extension into the Hijaz, allowed to secure the support of the large militarized Bedouin class."
    SAU_bet_on_the_hijaz_nobility:0 "Bet on the Hijazi nobility"
    SAU_bet_on_the_hijaz_nobility_desc:0 "Although the Kingdom of Hijaz was conquered by Abdulaziz, the local nobility was not removed from power. Even after the final elimination of Hijaz autonomy, the role of the local nobility in governing the state only increases. While the tribes would clearly be unhappy with the strengthening of the "arrogant townspeople," the support of the Hijaz aristocracy would help to modernize Nejd faster."
    SAU_flattening_economic_differences:0 "Flatten Economic Discrepancy"
    SAU_flattening_economic_differences_desc:0 "Now that culturally Nejd and Hijaz are no longer so different, we should iron out the economic differences between the two regions."
    SAU_support_for_compradors:0 "Support the Compradors"
    SAU_support_for_compradors_desc:0 "As in all Middle Eastern countries, the driving force of modernization in our country is not production, but trade. The initial accumulation of capital goes through a stage of compradorism - mediation between foreign companies and the country's market, serving foreign enterprises. This allows Arabian entrepreneurs to accumulate finances and experience, and later to become the financial bourgeoisie."
    SAU_establishment_of_the_arab_industry_development_department:0 "Create a Department for the Arab Industry Development"
    SAU_establishment_of_the_arab_industry_development_department_desc:0 "Foreign companies operating in our country need numerous local contractors. In response to their demands, more and more residents are setting up their own small businesses to produce building materials, furniture, bottles, ice, and car rental firms. The goal of the new department will be to mediate between local and foreign businesses."
    SAU_construction_of_modern_infrastructure:0 "Modernize the Infrastructure"
    SAU_construction_of_modern_infrastructure_desc:0 "Infrastructure development is one of the most important stages of state modernization. It is impossible to build a sufficiently strong economy in a country where nomads on camels still play an essential role in transporting goods."

    NWsaudi.1.t:0 "Tribal Uprising"
    NWsaudi.1.d:0 "For so long, the King succeeded in keeping the tribesmen subdued. However, they always had a hard time with the tax burden imposed and resented the fact that "some townsfolk" received more privileges than the noble Bedouins. \n\nLately, the discontent among the Bedouins had become more and more evident. The tribes that harbored a grudge against the King reared their heads again. Eventually, the Shammar tribe, which had long dreamed of restoring the Rashidi state, launched an open rebellion against the central government, convincing many other clans and even some disloyal Saudis to join the insurrection."
    NWsaudi.1.a:0 "We'll crush the rebels"
    NWsaudi.1.b:0 "Down with the tyrant!"

    NWsaudi.3.t:0 "Palace Coup"
    NWsaudi.3.d:0 "Although the King carried out radical reforms, he was able to control the ulema's dissatisfaction for a long time by using his status as the leader of all Wahhabis. However, over time, the conflict between the Islamic scholars and the king intensified. The ulema eventually issued a fatwa accusing the king of religious immorality and deviation from Islamic norms. This provided an opportunity for Prince Muhammad, who had long been seeking to increase his power in the kingdom, to take advantage of the situation. With the support of the ulema, Prince Muhammad's troops besieged Masmak Fort where the king was stationed. Although a small group of the king's guards tried to defend against the rebels, they were quickly defeated and surrendered. Prince Muhammad was proclaimed Sultan and chose not to use the title "king" in a Western manner."
    NWsaudi.3.a:0 "Long live the Sultan"

    NWsaudi.4.t:0 "[GetNewsHeadline]Coup in Saudi Arabia" # Omar Bin Hassan al-Sheikh
    NWsaudi.4.d:0 "Despite the relative moderation of King Abdulaziz's reforms, he failed to maintain his image as a pious and generous ruler, worthy of being the leader of all Wahhabis. After a long period of growing tension between the king and the clergy, the ulema openly accused Abdulaziz of religious immorality and deviation from Islamic norms. Taking advantage of the instability and the support of the clergy, Muhammad al Saud seized power in the country, proclaiming himself the new Sultan."
    NWsaudi.4.a:0 "Let's hope they won't go after foreign companies"
    NWsaudi.4.b:0 "Long live the Sultan"
    NWsaudi.4.c:0 "The Arabian Peninsula is unstable again"

    NWsaudi.5.t:0 "New Power"
    NWsaudi.5.d:0 "Although Muhammad al Saud has succeeded in taking the throne, his power is still unstable. The ulema's support allows the new sultan to hold onto power, but it also prevents him from acting on his own. \n\nA few days ago, the Council of Senior Scholars, headed by Grand Mufti Omar bin Hassan al-Sheikh, a descendant of the founder of the Wahhabi movement, was established, effectively claiming the role of the country's main center of power. \n\nIn the current situation, the new Sultan should either decide to confront the Council or accept the de facto limitation of his authority and legislate the position of senior ulema. However, it is worth bearing in mind that up to this point, the Islamic scholars had no hierarchy, so the council does not have the support of all the ulema."
    NWsaudi.5.a:0 "The ulema can only advise the monarch"
    NWsaudi.5.b:0 "We should comply"
    
    NWsaudi.6.t:0 "Beginning of the Hajj" ## Umrah
    NWsaudi.6.d:0 "The pilgrimage tax is the main source of income for Saudi Arabia. During the minor pilgrimage or umrah, the tax revenue is relatively low, but during the Hajj, when tens of thousands of Muslims travel to visit the holy places, tax revenue rises significantly. \n\nThe Hajj takes place every year on the eighth day of Zul-Hijjah and lasts for only five days, but many pilgrims stay in Saudi Arabia for a week or even a month. Some of them bring goods from their home countries, which offsets their travel expenses. The security provided to the Hajj caravans is also beneficial to professional merchants. For a short time, Saudi Arabia's markets are filled with an unprecedented abundance of textiles, spices, jewelry, and coffee."
    NWsaudi.6.a:0 "There is no God but Allah, and Muhammad is His Prophet"
    ## побивание (да именно так пишется) - Stoning of the Devil
    NWsaudi.7.d:0 "Today is the 8th of Zul-Hijjah in the year 1355, which means that the time of Hajj has come again. Tens of thousands of pilgrims from our country and other Muslim countries are preparing to run seven times between the hills of Safa and Marwa, take water from the sacred well Zamzam twice, listen to a sermon on Mount Arafat, take part in the rite of stoning of the Devil, and make a detour around the Kaaba."
    
    NWsaudi.8.d:0 "Every year, from 8 to 12 of zu al-Hijja according to the Islamic calendar, tens of thousands of pilgrims make the hajj, the sacred duty of every Muslim. In the days before and after the Hajj, the crowded streets of Mecca and surrounding villages fill with goods from all corners of the Islamic world, and the treasury of our state is significantly replenished by taxes on pilgrims and trade..."
    
    NWsaudi.9.d:0 "Every year, from 8 to 12 of zu al-Hijja according to the Islamic calendar, tens of thousands of pilgrims make the hajj, the sacred duty of every Muslim. Normally, the Hajj adds significantly to the state's treasury through the tax on pilgrims and increased trade, but this year, due to war and instability in the world, the flow of Muslims wishing to visit the holy places is extremely low."
    
    NWsaudi.10.t:0 "The Unsurpassable Noura"
    NWsaudi.10.d:0 "The charismatic personality of the king's eldest sister, Noura bint Abdul Rahman Al Saud, holds no small place in the history of Saudi Arabia. She was instrumental in strengthening Abdulaziz's determination to start a war to restore the Emirate of Riyadh when the Saudis were in exile in Kuwait. In addition, she married Saud al-Kabir, the most influential surviving member of the Al-Qabir branch of the House of Saudis claiming supreme power in the country, thereby securing his allegiance. \n\nNoura has always been quite progressive and outspoken. For example, when the telephone was first introduced into the country, many clergymen dismissed it as shaitan's tool, but Noura actively supported its use, saying that it was an amazing and necessary device for life. \n\nPossessing the 'mind of 40 men' and a good grasp of politics, Noura became one of Abdul Aziz's chief advisors and sometimes even served as his deputy. On several occasions, King Abdulaziz has been known to identify himself in public as 'Noura's brother'. \n\nHowever, although none of the ulema would dare speak openly about it, Noura's growing influence in the government is causing discontent among the conservative clergy, who believe that women should only do the work that men cannot do." #Noura bint Abdul Rahman Al Saud
    NWsaudi.10.a:0 "If they can't talk, let them keep their mouths shut"
    NWsaudi.10.b:0 "Perhaps we need to reconsider her powers after all"
    
    NWsaudi.11.t:0 "Bin Suleiman's New Project" 
    NWsaudi.11.d:0 "Finance Minister Abdullah bin Suleiman, who is sometimes referred to as 'His Excellency the Minister,' is one of the most influential figures at court, second only to King Abdulaziz's favorite son Faisal. Although the king rarely meets with anyone in private, bin Suleiman is allowed into the king's bedroom after general councils, where he presents his requests to the king. \n\nWhile King Abdulaziz sees it as his responsibility to deplete the treasury, bin Suleiman is tasked with replenishing it. However, during a recent private meeting, the finance minister sought the king's permission to allocate a significant amount of funds from the treasury to build the country's first hotel, with a focus on accommodating pilgrims."
    NWsaudi.11.a:0 "One can't deny a faithful friend money for a blessed project!"
    NWsaudi.11.b:0 "Let's not waste our state money"
    
    NWsaudi.12.t:0 "John Philby's Journey"
    NWsaudi.12.d:0 "John Philby, an adviser and close friend of Abdulaziz, played no small role in strengthening the Saudi state, advising the king on foreign policy. Even while working for British intelligence, he secretly sympathized with Ibn Saud and helped him make the right geopolitical decisions. After converting to Islam in 1930, Philby moved to Jeddah, where he played a key role in negotiating the SOCAL oil concession in Al-Hasa. \n\nIt was time to assign Philby a new mission. The lands acquired during the recently concluded Saudi-Yemeni War are rather poorly explored; we need to map the southern borders of our state. In addition, the International Medical Health Association's requirement to quarantine all Muslims traveling to Mecca and Medina has significantly reduced the flow of pilgrims and an alternative route to the holy sites must be found to circumvent this restriction. In addition, for John Philby, this expedition would also help to gain fame as the first European to explore the Najran region."
    NWsaudi.12.a:0 "No one could do this mission better than Philby"
    NWsaudi.12.b:0 "It's better he stay at the court"
    
    NWsaudi.13.t:0 "Philby in Najran"
    NWsaudi.13.d:0 "Today, the King's palace finally received the first update from John Philby, announcing his safe arrival in Najran. He had become the first European to cross the Rub' al Khali by car and to explore the nearby borderlands. In his report, Philby requested Abdulaziz's permission to travel north of the British Aden protectorate to search for the ruins of the mythical city of Shabwa. More importantly, he aimed to increase Saudi influence in a region already largely uncontrolled by the British. Philby's journey would be presented as his private initiative, supported by the governor of Najran, to minimize the risk of a diplomatic scandal." #Shabwa
    NWsaudi.13.a:0 "Finally, a good idea"
    NWsaudi.13.b:0 "Let's not complicate our relations with the Brits"
    
    NWsaudi.14.t:0 "The Lost City of Shabwa"
    NWsaudi.14.d:0 "In Europe, for several years now, the excitement around the ancient disappeared city of Shabwa has not subsided. Many people have sought to unravel the mystery of the "city of eighty temples," which was the center of the Kingdom of Hadhramaut in pre-Islamic Arabia. \n\nAfter several weeks of travel, John Philby unexpectedly managed to find Shabwa. He owed his discovery, however, largely to the good armed guards and the goodwill of the locals, who willingly helped Ibn Saud's envoy."
    NWsaudi.14.a:0 "A truly wonderful discovery"
     
    NWsaudi.15.t:0 "John Phildy Expedition"
    NWsaudi.15.d:0 "Today, we received alarming reports from the Aden Protectorate, stating that John Philby, an Arabist, has commenced a journey through the northern regions of the protectorate, under the protection of the Saudi governor of Najran's warriors. The expedition's official objective was to find the ancient city of Shabwa, believed to contain 60 temples. While the explorers were successful in locating the city, reports from Hadhramaut indicate that despite Philby's status as a British agent, his close relationship with Abdulaziz and his conversion to Islam led him to conduct a pro-Saudi propaganda campaign among the local Arab tribes. \n\nConsidering our weak authority over the tribes in the Aden protectorate and the lack of a clearly defined border, it may be prudent to ask Philby to leave our territories. However, given the limited number of British garrisons in the region, it would be challenging to use force if necessary."
    NWsaudi.15.a:0 "Phildy and his group shoud leave Aden"
    NWsaudi.15.b:0 "We should first get our troops ready beforehand"
     
    NWsaudi.16.t:0 "Brits Enraged"
    NWsaudi.16.d:0 "When Philby's unit arrived in the vicinity of Shabwa, the local tribes enthusiastically welcomed them, believing that the Saudi expedition was sent to include them under Abdulaziz's rule. Philby skillfully carried out a propaganda campaign promoting the historical rights of the Saudis to control the area surrounding Shabwah. \n\nPhilby's expedition sparked concern among British officials in Aden, who demanded that he leave the protectorate immediately. Despite our failure to extend territorial control in the region, the expedition managed to find an alternative route for pilgrims and somewhat expanded Saudi influence in the vicinity of the Shabwa ruins."
    NWsaudi.16.a:0 "Philby should leave Aden now"
     
    NWsaudi.17.t:0 "Instability in the Aden Protectorate"
    NWsaudi.17.d:0 "When Philby's unit arrived in the vicinity of Shabwa, the local tribes enthusiastically welcomed them, believing that the Saudi expedition was sent to include them under Abdulaziz's rule. Philby launched a propaganda campaign promoting the historical rights of the Saudis to control the environs of Shabwah, which further strengthened their influence over the region. \n\nHowever, the British administration's indecisiveness allowed the Saudis to expand their influence significantly. While the expedition was eventually withdrawn from the Aden protectorate to avoid an open confrontation with the United Kingdom, the Saudis' power over the local tribes was severely weakened."
    NWsaudi.17.a:0 "Wonderful news!"
    NWsaudi.17.b:0 "Damn bedouins!"
      
    NWsaudi.18.t:0 "Philby Returns"
    NWsaudi.18.d:0 "Philby's expedition to southern Saudi Arabia has finally concluded after more than a month of mapping the border areas of Asir and Najran. Despite the challenging terrain, he traveled great distances every day to complete this crucial task. While the border with Yemen had been marked before, Philby's precise mapping of the terrain has strengthened Saudi Arabia's control over the region."
    NWsaudi.18.a:0 "Welcome home, our dear friend"
    
    NWsaudi.19.t:0 "The King's Entourage" #Mohammed Suroor Sabban
    NWsaudi.19.d:0 "Abdulaziz's mild xenophobia and lack of enthusiasm for unfamiliar societies is reflected in the way major decisions are made by his inner circle, despite the increasing complexity of Saudi Arabia's administrative and bureaucratic apparatus. His splendid hospitality and genuine friendly attention help to mask this trait. Abdulaziz prefers to keep the same people around him day and night, year after year. These are the people he trusts implicitly, knowing their virtues and faults intimately, and he generously rewards them by increasing their resources. \n\nAs time passes, however, Abdulaziz is increasingly in need of advisors to help modernize the state. Mohammed Suroor Sabban, a pioneering writer, intellectual and economist close to bin Suleiman, could be such an advisor. His reformist ideas, however, might be seen as radical by the conservative nobility and even by the King himself. Although the entourage of the King is rarely replenished with new people, Sabban's appointment could provide the necessary impetus for modernization, despite the challenges it might entail."
    NWsaudi.19.a:0 "The king has enough advisers to help him modernize the country"
    NWsaudi.19.b:0 "Bin Suleiman's associate would make a good ally for the King"
    
    NWsaudi.20.t:0 "The Al-Ahli Football Club" # Al-Ittihad, Al-Ahli, Al-Falah, Ohod
    NWsaudi.20.d:0 "Jeddah has become the focal point of Saudi Arabia's burgeoning sports culture, with the city being the birthplace of the country's first soccer club, Al-Ittihad, in 1927. \n\nRecently, a group of students from Al-Falah School, the oldest educational institution in Jeddah, established the Al-Ahli football club, which will compete with Al-Ittihad players, along with the Ohod club, founded a year ago in Medina. This development marks a significant milestone in the growth of sports in the country, with the emergence of new clubs signaling a promising future for sports in Saudi Arabia."
    NWsaudi.20.a:0 "We are witnessing the birth of professional sports in Saudi Arabia"
    
    NWsaudi.21.t:0 "The Father of Two Evils" #Muhammad bin Abdulaziz, Abu Sharayn, (the father of two evils)
    NWsaudi.21.d:0 "Prince Muhammad bin Abdulaziz, who had participated in numerous wars in the young Saudi state from an early age, was famous for his aggressive and cruel character. After growing up and being appointed governor of Medina, he remained as harsh as when he was a child. Moreover, the prince has recently become an increasingly frequent guest at parties in Beirut, where alcohol, banned in Saudi Arabia, flows freely. \n\nAlthough Mohammed is nicknamed 'Abu Sharayn' (The Father of Two Evils) for his bad temper and drinking habits by members of the ruling dynasty, no one denies that he is also a competent administrator and a good military leader who has proven his courage and determination in battle."
    NWsaudi.21.a:0 "We will turn a blind eye to the unworthy behavior of a true Wahhabi prince"
    NWsaudi.21.b:0 "He is an embarrassment to the Al Saud family"
    
    NWsaudi.22.t:0 "Judicial Question"
    NWsaudi.22.d:0 "The government of Saudi Arabia has long aimed to unify the country's legal and judicial system based on Shariah. However, many tribes still follow the Urf and Adat, which are a body of popular jurisprudence and serve as the principal sources of law. For instance, the Urf allows for the granting of asylum to persecuted persons under certain circumstances, even though the right of asylum is not recognized by the centralized state. \n\nThe Bedouins consider certain acts, such as robbery and murder, to be heroic if committed outside their tribe, whereas these same actions are regarded as crimes if committed within the tribe. This runs counter to the needs and policies of the government. \n\nWe could take a drastic step and enforce Sharia law in all the tribes, but such an approach might not be effective and could provoke resentment among the Bedouins. Therefore, it might be wiser to expand the judicial powers of the provincial emirs and enforce Sharia law in specific areas, such as taxation, family law, inheritance, and others."
    NWsaudi.22.a:0 "We must launch a vigorous attack on pagan customs"
    NWsaudi.22.b:0 "We should implement Sharia gradually"
    
    NWsaudi.23.t:0 "The Monarch Ropes"
    NWsaudi.23.d:0 "During an encounter in the palace in Riyadh, a member of the ulema witnessed the monarch wearing a long robe that touched the floor. The ulema exclaimed, "Allah-Allah! [ROOT.GetLeader], your pride has overcome you. Your clothes are dragging on the floor." In response, the monarch promptly ordered a servant to bring scissors, which he then handed to the theologian, saying, "Cut off what you think is contrary to Islam.""
    NWsaudi.23.a:0 "The ulema can see anything as contrary to Islam!"
    
    NWsaudi.24.t:0 "Uprising Preparation?"
    NWsaudi.24.d:0 "Today, the Emir of Burayda received a letter from Sheikh bin Zuhairi accusing a neighboring tribe of preparing an uprising. Despite lacking any supporting evidence, the accusations cannot be entirely dismissed due to previous doubts about the tribe's loyalty. However, there is no concrete indication of any brewing unrest at present."
    NWsaudi.24.a:0 "Conduct an immediate raid on the tribe"
    NWsaudi.24.b:0 "Ignore it for now"
    
    NWsaudi.25.t:0 "Raid"
    NWsaudi.25.d:0 "After the successful raid by our troops, which led to the capture of the disloyal tribesmen and their leaders, we received new information. It turned out that the sheikh Zuhairi had written the denunciation falsely accusing the rival tribe of preparing an uprising to weaken their power and take control of their territories. The Bedouins who were raided were merely dissatisfied with the tax oppression, and they had no plans for an uprising as previously thought. This new information shows that we must be cautious in accepting accusations without proper evidence, especially when it comes to inter-tribal disputes."
    NWsaudi.25.a:0 "We will have to let all the captives go."
    
    NWsaudi.26.t:0 "The fate of the 'Uncrowned King'"
    NWsaudi.26.d:0 "During the reign of Abdulaziz, Finance Minister Abdallah bin Suleiman was one of the most influential people at court. As a close friend of the King, he had almost unlimited powers in the economic sphere, for which he was even nicknamed the "uncrowned king of Saudi Arabia. Now that the Saudis have been removed from most important positions, tribal leaders are demanding that bin Suleiman be removed as well."
    NWsaudi.26.a:0 "We cannot lose a competent economist"
    NWsaudi.26.b:0 "He should retire"
    
    NWsaudi.27.t:0 "New Flag"
    NWsaudi.27.d:0 "In the production of our country's flags, the white stripe is often disregarded. It may be worthwhile to officially establish the design of the flag without the stripe as a standard."
    NWsaudi.27.a:0 "Good, let's do it"
    NWsaudi.27.b:0 "We won't change flag design"
    
    
    NWsaudi.501.t:0 "Tribal Conflict"
    NWsaudi.501.d:0 "The news of a new territorial conflict between two tribes has reached us. The clashes were triggered by the Bedouins driving their camels to other pastures. \n\nAlthough the central government usually doesn't interfere in tribal affairs, this conflict could potentially destabilize the region. One option is to order the local emir to intervene and subdue the Bedouins to prevent the situation from escalating further."
    NWsaudi.501.a:0 "We should intervene"
    NWsaudi.501.b:0 "The tribes would not appreciate our meddling"
    
    NWsaudi.502.t:0 "Tribes Clash"
    NWsaudi.502.d:0 "Today, news of a clash between two tribesmen near a desert well reached us. Unfortunately, one of the Bedouins lost his life. The tribal sheikhs were able to settle the conflict amicably by ordering the killer to pay a ransom for the deceased."
    NWsaudi.502.a:0 "Praise Allah, it did not come to blood feuds."
    
    NWsaudi.503.d:0 "Today, we received news of a violent clash between two tribes near a desert well resulting in the death of several Bedouins. The incident has rekindled long-standing blood feuds between the tribes, and the situation is at risk of escalating into a full-blown conflict."
    NWsaudi.503.a:0 "Sharia judges resolve conflict peacefully"
    NWsaudi.503.b:0 "We won't intervene"
    
    NWsaudi.504.t:0 "A Disgruntled Chief"
    NWsaudi.504.d:0 "According to our customs, the ruler is obliged to give a gift to everyone who comes to his court. Today, more than five hundred people were welcomed by our king. However, one of the tribal chiefs who visited Riyadh was unhappy with the number of coins he received on behalf of the ruler. It was considerably less than the previous year, which upset the Bedouin chief. He began to shout and demand a larger gift, and we are concerned that his dissatisfaction may lead to disloyalty towards the ruler. We need to carefully consider how to address this situation and find a solution that will maintain the loyalty of the Bedouin chief and his tribe."
    NWsaudi.504.a:0 "Give him more coins and offer a sincere apology on behalf of the King"
    NWsaudi.504.b:0 "He will not receive one rial more!"
    
    NWsaudi.505.t:0 "Expensive Hospitality"
    NWsaudi.505.d:0 "Any Arab, especially a nomad, believes that it is customary for the King to give a gift to those who visit his court. Many Bedouins travel for hundreds of kilometers to receive gifts from the ruler. In addition, a significant number of underprivileged people live in the capital at the king's expense. There are about a hundred families of honorary captives with their servants and slaves, whose maintenance is paid from the treasury. \n\nThe king's court is usually visited by around 500 to 1,000 people per day, but today the number of guests has exceeded 10,000. Although most of them are unrelated, the King's hospitality may put a significant strain on the treasury, especially if the number of "guests" does not decrease in the following days."
    NWsaudi.505.a:0 "Allah has granted the King his wealth, so he is obliged to share it"
    NWsaudi.505.b:0 "Some of the gift should be ensured by ulema"
    NWsaudi.505.c:0 "It is worth reducing the value of gifts"
    
    NWsaudi.506.t:0 "Attack on Pilgrimsв"
    NWsaudi.506.desc:0 "The government makes significant efforts to ensure the safety of pilgrims on their journey to the holy sites, but it is still a hazardous undertaking. Unfortunately, recent reports suggest that a tribe in the Hijaz region is engaging in attacks against travelers with the apparent approval of their sheikh. Despite the government's financial support to the Bedouins to discourage such looting, it appears that the tribe is still struggling to sustain itself and is thus forced to resort to illegal means."
    NWsaudi.506.a:0 "The sheikh and all those involved in the robberies should be severely punished"
    NWsaudi.506.b:0 "Cut off the hand of only the robbers themselves"
    NWsaudi.506.c:0 "Punish the raiders while increasing tribal payments"
    NWsaudi.506.d:0 "Sentence the raiders to 70 strokes with a stick"
    
    NWsaudi.507.d:0 "We have received news that a group of Bedouins attacked pilgrims en route to Mecca, but a cavalry patrol successfully located and captured the perpetrators. The attackers were later identified as the sons of one of the sheikhs, who came to the court pleading for mercy on behalf of his sons. However, the ulema, Islamic scholars, emphasized that attacking pilgrims should be punishable by death according to religious law."
    NWsaudi.507.a:0 "Cut off the hand of the raiders"
    NWsaudi.507.b:0 "Execute the criminals"
    
    NWsaudi.508.t:0 "Truck Attacks"
    NWsaudi.508.d:0 "Lately we have been receiving more and more news of increasing attacks on vehicles in one of the country's provinces. The development of road transport is an essential aspect of the modernization of the state, but it is causing resentment among the tribes that traditionally transport goods across the desert. Some Bedouins have attacked trucks, opening fire on their headlights to "shoot the eyes off the shaitan". It is not uncommon for vehicles to be subjected to the usual robbery raids."
    NWsaudi.508.a:0 "Tough measures need to be taken"
    NWsaudi.508.b:0 "Local Shariah judges will handle the situation"
    NWsaudi.508.c:0 "Let's hire tribes to guard the trucks"
    
    NWsaudi.509.t:0 "Piligrim Infrastructure"
    NWsaudi.509.d:0 "The journey to the holy cities of Islam has traditionally been a challenging experience for Muslim pilgrims. However, the ulema now believe that the government has the resources to improve the transportation infrastructure in [679.GetName] to make the pilgrimage easier and safer."
    NWsaudi.509.a:0 "It makes sense to honor that request"
    
    NWsaudi.510.d:0 "The journey to the holy cities of Islam has traditionally been a challenging experience for Muslim pilgrims.

    NWsaudi.28.t:0 "Consultative Assembly of Saudi Arabia"
    NWsaudi.28.d:0 "In 1932, the Majlis ash-Shura was convened for the first time in Hejaz, before the formation of the centralized Kingdom of Saudi Arabia through the merging of Nejd and Hejaz. This move was intended to give greater legitimacy to the elimination of Hijaz autonomy, although many state institutions were not yet relocated to Riyadh at the time. \n\nAs time passed, it became increasingly evident that the advisory council needed to be reconvened at the national level to enhance the king's decision-making process. The Majlis ash-Shura is supposed to be comprised of the council president, two deputies, and ten permanent members. The king will have to decide whom to appoint to the council."
    NWsaudi.28.a:0 "Form a council of prominent Nejj and Hijazi officials"

    NWsaudi.29.t:0 "IPC Requests Concession"
    NWsaudi.29.d:0 "For a long time, it was believed that there were no oil deposits on the Saudi territory, and the British oil companies that dominated the region were quite satisfied with the current level of production. Only the American company Standard Oil of California agreed in 1933 to lease a concession to search for oil in Al-Hasa. \n\nAlthough SOCAL did not manage to achieve any significant results in the search for oil in our country during 3 years, the British Iraq Petroleum Company made an offer to lease a concession in the territory of Hijaz. Although the British are skeptical about the prospects of oil production on the territory of Saudi Arabia, apparently, they do not want to allow the Americans to strengthen their influence on the Kingdom and want to compete with SOCAL."
    NWsaudi.29.a:0 "We have no reason to refuse this offer"
    NWsaudi.29.b:0 "We would prefer to cooperate only with SOCAL"
    
    NWsaudi.30.t:0 "British Liquidate Oil Concession"
    NWsaudi.30.d:0 "The results of the search for oil in Hijaz turned out to be disappointing. After spending a significant amount of money on the expedition and on payments to the oil treasury, Iraq Petroleum Company was forced to abandon the concession."
    NWsaudi.30.a:0 "At least they have brought in some tens of thousands of pounds extra into our treasury"
    
    NWsaudi.31.t:0 "Dammam No.7 Drilling"
    NWsaudi.31.d:0 "While there are currently 62 Americans and over a thousand Saudi workers working in the Dammam area of Al-Hasa, SOCAL has not yet found any significant oil fields. The first well, No. 1, never yielded any oil. No. 2 produced ten times as much water as oil. No. 3 was barely pumping 100 barrels of heavy crude oil with a dash of water in it. No. 4 and No. 5 turned out to be as dry as a bone that had lain in the summer sun. No. 6, which was 1380 meters deep, yielded a small amount of oil mixed with water.\n\nThree years have passed since the concession agreement was signed, and at the SOCAL board meetings, the question arises: “Should the Arabian concession be scrapped? Isn’t it better to write off a few million dollars in losses now, rather than incur much higher losses in a few years?” There is no clear answer to that question.\n\nIn the meantime, the board of directors agreed to drill the seventh well..."
    NWsaudi.31.a:0 "There is nothing we can do"
    
    NWsaudi.32.t:0 "SOCAL Board of Directors"
    NWsaudi.32.d:0 "Working on the Dammam No.7 well was difficult; chains were breaking, drills were being lost, and numerous breakdowns forced work to be suspended. Ten months later, the first signs of oil appeared at a depth of over 1,000 meters, but by that time, the company's capabilities and the patience of its owners had almost run out. \n\nToday, Max Steineke, the chief geologist of the Arabian expedition, was summoned to California. At a meeting of the SOCAL Board of Directors, he once again spoke about the surveys he had conducted. When asked if he was sure that the Dammam No.7 well would produce oil, Steineke honestly said, "There is no absolute certainty. It all depends on a combination of circumstances. But we're somewhere near the oil horizon." \n"So the costs are approaching ten million dollars, and the prospects of finding oil remain dim!" one of the company's directors exclaimed. \n"Gentlemen, there is a copy of the Bahrain field in the depths of Arabia. We're just a little out of luck!" assured the chief geologist."
    NWsaudi.32.a:0 "American concession brings a lot of money to our treasury, and we would not want to lose that revenue source."
    
    NWsaudi.33.t:0 "Al-Hasa Concession Liquidated"
    NWsaudi.33.d:0 "An official note from the [FROM.GetAdjective] government was sent today informing us that our oil concession in Al-Hasa has been liquidated. Our geologists must leave [FROM.GetName] as soon as possible."
    NWsaudi.33.a:0 "This is an outrageous violation of our agreements!"

    NWsaudi.34.d:0 "As we're now at war with [?var:concession_owner.GetName], their oil concession in Al-Hasa has been canceled."
    NWsaudi.34.a:0 "I see"

    NWsaudi.35.d:0 "Today we received an offer from the [FROM.GetAdjective] government to continue the Al-Hasa oil consession. In exchange, they will provide payments that will be quite useful."
    NWsaudi.35.a:0 "This offer is very beneficial"
    NWsaudi.35.b:0 "We're not interested"
    
    NWsaudi.36.t:0 "[FROM.GetAdjective] Defaint"
    NWsaudi.36.d:0 "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government is reluctant to develop oil in Al-Hasa."
    NWsaudi.36.a:0 "A sad day"
    
    NWsaudi.37.d:0 "The SOCAL board of directors was meeting today to decide whether to reduce or completely discontinue funding due to the ineffectiveness of the work in the Dammam area. Max Steineke was not allowed into the meeting room, but he burst in with a sheet of paper in hand. The normally composed German was in a state of extreme excitement. "There is oil!" he shouted triumphantly and threw a telegram onto the table that he had just received from Saudi Arabia. The telegram stated that Dammam No. 7, drilled to a depth of 1,440 meters, had struck oil. \n\nOn the first day, the well produced only 2,130 barrels, then more and more, and a few days later, it produced 3,372 barrels. The resumed work at Dammams No. 2 and 4 also yielded good results. It became clear that a new oil-bearing layer had been discovered and that there was more oil in Arabia."
    NWsaudi.37.a:0 "A remarkable day in our history"
    
    NWsaudi.38.t:0 "A Visit to the Well."
    NWsaudi.38.d:0 "Even in his mature years, our king retained his curiosity, inquisitiveness, and interest in new things. He wanted to see the famous well that had played such a significant role in his country's fate. The representatives from the oil company suggested that the trip to the Eastern Province should be postponed to coincide with the opening of the pipeline, and the king agreed. \n\nA few days ago, a large procession of 400 Cadillacs, Fords, Chevrolets, and other cars crossed the desert to arrive in Dhahran. Accompanying the king were his eldest sons, retainers, wives, and servants. Near one of the oases, 350 tents were pitched to accommodate numerous guests.  \n\nWith great interest, [SAU.GetLeader] rode through the desert to see the first hotbed of the kingdom's future oil industry. He saw an oil well and strings of pipelines for the first time in his life and was given flasks of oil samples to inspect. As he examined the dark, oily liquid, he was glad to know that Allah had been merciful and had given them another source of wealth, "black gold" instead of yellow. \n\n[SAU.GetLeader] left Dhahran in the most magnificent spirits. At last, he had found a large and reliable source to replenish his treasury, as oil was in ever-increasing demand on the world market. He could now be assured of the kingdom's financial future."
    NWsaudi.38.a:0 "Allah is gracious!"
    
    NWsaudi.39.t:0 "[FROM.GetAdjective] Demands"
    NWsaudi.39.d:0 "After the [FROM.GetAdjective] has captured Lahij, the situation around Aden is getting tenser and tenser.

    NWsaudi.43.d:0 "The [SAU.GetAdjective] government, which has adopted a policy of supporting Arab anti-colonial movements, has called on us to begin negotiations in order to achieve the independence of the [FROM.GetName] state. [SAU.GetAdjective] diplomats believe that our country should show solidarity with the resurgent Arab world and give [FROM.GetAdjective] the people the right to decide their own destiny. No doubt there is only cold calculation behind these demands, but will we risk confrontation with warlike Arabs?"
    NWsaudi.43.a:0 "These proposals are absurd"
    NWsaudi.43.b:0 "We don't have enough resources to deal with conflict in Arabia"
    
    NWsaudi.44.t:0 "Negotiations Failed"
    NWsaudi.44.d:0 "As expected, the negotiations with the British government were fruitless. They only increased tensions in the region and provoked clashes among the border troops."

    NWsaudi.46.d:0 "The invasion of our protectorate by [SAU.GetAdjective] troops came as a complete surprise to the local garrisons, who were unable to offer significant resistance to the enemy. This defeat had a negative impact on our international prestige and we should probably start preparing a retaliatory invasion."

    NWsaudi.50.d:0 "The war between the Kathiri and Qu'aiti sultanates has been ongoing for decades, with the Kathiri only formally recognizing British rule, while Qu'aiti enjoys active support from the United Kingdom, which doesn't want to directly intervene in the conflict. The Kathiris' hope for dominance in Hadhramaut has proven unlikely, with the sultanate losing access to the sea, which has undermined their economy and ability to procure weapons. Nonetheless, [FROM.GetLeader] intends to attempt to shift the conflict's balance by utilizing an unmarked desert border to supply weapons to the Kathiri Sultanate."

Zakat is considered to be sanctified by "true" Islam and "monotheism," and its collectors are seen as the government's eyes among the Bedouins, thereby maintaining the central government's authority. Increasing zakat would greatly empower the state, but it may lead to resentment among the tribes, which are already burdened by taxes.

About a hundred families of honorary prisoners are kept in the capital. The king pays for the upkeep of their houses, stables, camels, clothing, food, and slaves. The regular number of guests at the court is 500, sometimes the king treats up to 10,000 people. Many Bedouins travel many hundreds of kilometers to receive gifts from the king. It is important to note that this gift is the responsibility of the ruler. Any Arab, especially a nomad, who has received a gift from the king, large or small, in money, clothing or provisions, considers that he is already entitled to such a gift every year or on each of his visits to the court. If he is not given a gift, he feels insulted and may even subsequently join the king's enemies. Reducing spending on the ruler's guests would free up substantial funds that could be spent on more important needs, but such a break with tradition would cause resentment from many segments of the population."

    NWsaudi.52.d:0 "Although Abdullah ibn Mitab was proclaimed sultan of Arabia during the revolt supported by the Shammar tribe, not all tribes have endorsed him. Soon after the defeat of the mainstream Wahhabis, Muhammad ibn Talal al-Rashid decided to openly challenge Abdullah. He gained support from the aristocracy and some tribes of Hijaz who feared the excessive strengthening of the "unruly" tribes of the north."
    NWsaudi.52.a:0 "Once again the Al Rashid family is torn apart by internecine conflicts..."
    
    NWsaudi52a_tt:0 "§RIf tribal loyalty falls below 50%, there will be a palace coup.\nThe risk of a coup will remain until the rift is resolved by killing one of the opponents, civil war, or the partition of the country.§!"'

    NWsaudi.53.t:0 "Old Grudges"
    NWsaudi.53.d:0 "Abdullah ibn Mitab became ruler of the emirate of Jabal Shammar in 1920, when the Rashidi state was living its last months under constant attack by the Saudis. Muhammad ibn Talal then swore allegiance to the new emir and promised to defend Hail, but Abdullah, who did not trust him, ordered that ibn Talal be arrested. Some time later, however, the hierarchs released the prisoner and proclaimed him Emir, forcing Abdullah to flee from Hail to the Saudis. \nNow that the Rashidis again dominate Arabia, Muhammad's supporters will use these events to prove the Sultan's injustice to his loyal subjects. We must respond to these charges somehow. \nIn particular, we can bet on the fact that Abdullah asserted his right to the throne during the second war with the Saudis. Muhammad has no right to weave intrigues to smear the man who has ensured that the Wahhabis no longer terrorize Arabia. However, we can also try to enter into an argument with our opponents and call Muhammad's arrest order legitimate, since his subsequent coup proved his disloyalty and lust for power."
    NWsaudi.53.a:0 "Our recent achievements are more important than old disagreements"
    NWsaudi.53.b:0 "The arrest was legal"
    
    NWsaudi.54.t:0 "End of Discussion"
    NWsaudi.54.d:0 "Abdullah's attempt to claim most of the credit for his achievements against the Saudis was met with a decidedly negative response from the tribesmen, who believe that ibn Mitab became sultan only because the nomads allowed it. Moreover, according to the Bedouins, the Sultan is only the first among equals among the sheikhs, and has no right to resemble the Wahhabis by forbidding any criticism of himself."
    NWsaudi.54.a:0 "We've failed"
    
    NWsaudi.55.d:0 "The arguments with Muhammad's supporters did not completely erase the position of his opponents who criticized Abdullah for his flight to the Saudis and his insufficient preparation for the defense of Hail. However, we were able to persuade many of the tribal sheikhs to our side, who now view Muhammad as a traitor and some even demand his execution. Despite this, the Sultan's power is still too fragile to take decisive action at this time."
    NWsaudi.55.a:0 "The truth is on our side"
    
    NWsaudi.56.t:0 "Property Redistribution"
    NWsaudi.56.d:0 "Many tribes view [ROOT.GetLeader] as a weak leader who is easily influenced, or at least as a leader who will listen to the tribes who supported him during his ascension to the throne. These tribes hope to gain control of some of the pastures, wells, and camels owned by the townspeople and tribes who supported the Saudis. However, this could lead to the impoverishment and starvation of many people as the defeated clans are already weakened and unable to resist such a redistribution of property."
    NWsaudi.56.a:0 "The tribes' desire is absolutely right"
    NWsaudi.56.b:0 "We shall confine ourselves to a partial redistribution of property"
    
    NWsaudi.57.t:0 "Tribal Bribery"
    NWsaudi.57.d:0 "We have recently heard rumors that the Sultan's opponents have begun to bribe the tribes who remain neutral in the struggle for the throne. We could also engage in giving gifts to the Bedouins, but this would reduce the already very small coffers of the state."

    NWsaudi.58.d:0 "News has reached us that in several regions of our country the Wahhabis have decided to take up arms again in order to overthrow the power of the "Hail Idolaters". This desperate attempt at rebellion is doomed to failure and the viceroys manage to keep the situation under control. We can immediately assemble all available forces to quell the rebellion, but without proper preparation we may suffer too many casualties, both from Wahhabi raids and troop attrition. Perhaps we should take some time to prepare the logistics before assembling all available forces to quell the rebellion."
    NWsaudi.58.a:0 "We shall act at once"
    NWsaudi.58.b:0 "A hasty performance will lead to too many losses"
    
    NWsaudi.59.t:0 "Rebellion Suppressed"
    NWsaudi.59.d:0 "Our troops succeeded in suppressing the Wahhabi uprising, but our attack was poorly prepared. Given the lack of intelligence, the eager sheikhs acted too chaotically, often underestimating the enemy strength."
    NWsaudi.59.a:0 "Yet we still won"
    
    NWsaudi.60.d:0 "Despite the eagerness of many sheikhs to go into battle immediately, the sultan allowed more time to rally troops and supplies to the area of the rebellion before launching active operations. Although the uprising was eventually crushed, the sultan's opponents claimed that his indecisive actions were further evidence of his secret sympathies for the Wahhabis. They alleged that during his years of honorable captivity in Riyadh, [ROOT.GetLeader] was heavily influenced by the Saudis. When he became sultan, he sought to establish relations with the supporters of Wahhabism and restore the order that had existed under Abdulaziz from the beginning."
