LIE_fund_landespolizei_desc:0 "Our police force, the Landespolizei, is severely underfunded even for a small country such as ours is. This state of affairs can no longer be accepted, as they are an essential part in securing internal stability and the position of the Haus Liechtenstein itself, especially in regards to the rising popularity of the "Volksdeutsche Bewegung", calling for union with Nazi Germany."

LIE_arms_for_landespolizei_desc:0 "Of course, especially since we lack any kind of Armed Force, the police needs to be equipped with arms in order to protect the Prince and the stability of the Fürstentum. Thus far we have relied on pistols and a few antiquated rifles, now with the increased funding however, some new modern swiss rifles can be purchased, alongside a couple of light machine guns."

LIE_retake_control_grenztruppen_desc:0 "Following the End of the Great War we rennounced our previous customs agreement with Austria, thus the Liechtensteiner Grenzwache was formed, in order to protect our borders to Austria and Switzerland, with a strength of exactly 30 men. In 1924 we agreed with Switzerland that the Swiss Grenzwachtkorps would take over duties with 60 men, thus our Grenzwache was disbanded. It is time to once again protect us ourselves, we can not solely rely on the Swiss."

Many parts of the royal family live in Moravia, Czechoslovakia where the Haus Liechtenstein owns siginificant portions of land. Franz has now announced his intention to move the family´s main place of buinsess to Vaduz itself, a move the future Prince Franz Joseph II. will surely follow suit."

liechtenstein_events.5.desc:0 "Today, 19th of April ´39, Andreas Kieber, famously the "last Liechtensteiner soldier" passed away peacefully in his bed. \n\nBorn 4th of October 1844 in Mauren, Liechtenstein, he worked as a farmer; in 1866, upon the outbreak of the Austro-Prussian War, he was a soldier of the 80-man strong Liechtenstein contingent led by Peter Rheinberger that was deployed on the Stelvio Pass against Italy, although the unit did not see any action. He remained in the military until it was disbanded in 1868 due to its unpopularity within the country, after which Liechtenstein declared its permanent neutrality. Kieber was a member of the Liechtenstein veterans association, which was founded in 1893 and consisted of 141 members in 1896. \nIn his later years, he was honoured with photographs of him in his uniform which were used in various postcards. Upon his death, he has now been recognised as the last surviving member of the Liechtenstein military and nicknamed the "last Liechtenstein soldier"."
