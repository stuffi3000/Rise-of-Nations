 ETH_befriend_eng_desc:0 "We may not trust Britain, and quite frankly we probably shouldn't.

We must make nice or die."
 ETH_follow_jap:0 "Follow the Japanese Example"
 ETH_follow_jap_desc:0 "The events of the war have only proven the thoughts of Herouy Wolde Selassie and the other 'Young Japanisers' correct. The West fears a Japan of Africa, as they should. We rise with the sun, in the model of Japan."
 ETH_leave_lon:0 "Leave the League of Nations"
 ETH_leave_lon_desc:0 "Enough of the hypocrisy, enough of the inaction. The League works only for the powerful countries and does nothing for those who need it. It has become clear that the model of internationalism is fundamentally broken. We must speak for ourselves, because no-one else will."

 ETH_improve_encryption:0 "Improve Encryption"
 ETH_improve_encryption_desc:0 "Our country has relied mainly on runners do to our lack of radio for many years, and although we have now begun acquiring radios we do still have a problem.

 ETH_more_congress:0 "Increase the Power of the Legislature"
 ETH_more_congress_desc:0 "The current constitution has the Parliament acting largely as an advisory body with little true power, with its main advantage being the ability to keep the nobles tied up in the capital as senators rather than causing trouble at home.

 ETH_swedish_quality_desc:0 "The Swedish were one of our more vocal supporters during the war, and we shall never forget that. Their weapon quality has been proven and we know that we can trust them. This is a good time to deepen our relationship with them."
 ETH_go_communist:0 "The Voice of the People"
 ETH_go_communist_desc:0 "For far too long the people of Ethiopia have been oppressed. Even as power has supposedly been granted to them, it only hides the fact that the true masters remain the same. The people work and others benefit. The time has come so that every person gains the benefit of their own labour."
 ETH_com_militias:0 "From Levies to Militias"
 ETH_com_militias_desc:0 "Every man is expected to be ready to fight for the Empire in case of attack.

 ETH_as_in_the_east_desc:0 "The Japanese are the rightful rulers of the Far East, their actions and power speak to theat. The Germans have proven themselves the masters of Europe. But what of Africa?

 ETH_abolish_slavery:0 "Abolish the Gedar System"
 ETH_abolish_slavery_desc:0 "The Gedar system is a horribly outdated idea that significantly weakens our outside influence and restricts our ability to modernize. Sure the nobles like this feudalistic system that encourages what essentally amounts to slavery, but the Italians got a lot of positive press for claiming to be coming in to abolish this system. We cannot allow another country to define the narrative in such a way ever again!"

 ETH_grab_djibuoti_desc:0 "France has fallen, and it can no longer protect it's colonies. We will never have a better chance to seize Djibouti. The garrison there is strong, but perhaps we can convince them and what remains of the French government to surrender peacefully."
 ETH_grab_somaliland:0 "Demand British Somaliland"
 ETH_grab_somaliland_desc:0 "British Somaliland stands as an affront to our destiny of controlling the Horn of Africa. Either they stand down peacefully, or we take the province by force, and it's not like the British are currently in any position to refuse!"

 ETH_buy_planes:0 "Plane Purchases"
 ETH_buy_planes_desc:0 "We can only build planes so quickly when we have so little industry. We must look to see if any countries are willing to sell us their overstock. Even out-of-date models will allow us to build up a fleet and give our would-be pilots experience in the air."

 ETH_integrate_eritrea:0 "Eritrean Integration"
 ETH_integrate_eritrea_desc:0 "We have finally reclaimed the lost province of Eritrea! We need to re-integrate these people back into our empire as soon as possible. Unfortunately, there are those who would stand in our way, the so-called Eritrean nationalists who foolishly believe that Eritrea's destiny differs from the Empires. Perhaps we could assuage some of their members by grantingt the province greater autonomy, for now."
 ETH_crush_eritrea:0 "Crush Eritrean Nationalism"
 ETH_crush_eritrea_desc:0 "The Eritreans have proven to be slippery and traitorous. Already there are those within the province that demand self-government! This kind of anti-imperial sentiment cannot be tolerated!"
 ETH_establish_somalian_puppet:0 "A Land for the Somalis"
 ETH_establish_somalian_puppet_desc:0 "The various Somali peoples in our lands have long not exactly been the most stable subjects. However, this largely stems from the lack of a coutnry they can truly call their own that isn't ours. With our control of Somalia, we can change that. We will create a highly autonomous puppet state under the governership of a loyal Somali. This will hopefully quell much of the Somali unrest in our country."
 ETH_order_in_somalia:0 "Force Somalian Integration"
 ETH_order_in_somalia_desc:0 "The Somalians in our country have long resisted and resented our rule. They simply refuse to follow the rules of the empire. For too long we have been unable to punish this behavior, but times have changed. They will obey our rule, or else."
 ETH_another_light:0 "Another Light Against The Darkness"
 ETH_another_light_desc:0 "Germany's expansion has gone from worrying to downright terrifying. We must stand up to this egregious breach of international trust. We must not allow another country to be invaded as we were, and we will not stop at mere finger-pointing!"
 ETH_join_japan:0 "African-Asian Prosperity"

 ETH_elecronic_focus_desc:0 "Elctricity and electronics in general are severely lacking in our country. We should begin to put serious thought into creating an electrical framework.

 ETH_modern_weapons:0 "Weapons for the Modern Age"
 ETH_modern_weapons_desc:0 "The importance of modern weaponry may be somewhat overstated at times, we ourselves have proven this multiple time. But we still cannot pretend that they are very helpful. Our country relies far too heavily on pre-established weaponry, much of it pre-1900. The time has definitely come for an upgrade. Several upgrades actually."
 ETH_trucks:0 "Capacity for Mechanized Units"
 ETH_trucks_desc:0 "Our country has only recently been getting involved with automobiles. Our country is largely not conducive to them, but with changing technologies this has become less and less of an excuse.

 ETH_motor_infr:0 "Road Construction"
 ETH_motor_infr_desc:0 "One of the major issues our country faces is a serious lack of roads, especially paved ones. Granted, mountain roads are hard to make and mantain, but we must do so if we wish to connect our country and join the modern world."
 ETH_tank_focus:0 "Our Own Armor"
 ETH_tank_focus_desc:0 "The Italians used armour against us in the war, and we proved that it was not as great as advertised, at least in the north. The south however tells us a different story, armour in a flat setting can be absolutely devastating, and we need to create some of our own as soon as possible!"
 ETH_arty_focus:0 "Modern Artillery"
 ETH_arty_focus_desc:0 "Our artillery is, in many cases, laughable. We still have cannons, actual cannons, in our arsenal. This is unacceptable for a modern army. Work must be done in order to rectify this problem."
 ETH_anti_tank_focus:0 "Anti-Tank Preparedness"
 ETH_anti_tank_focus_desc:0 "Our country wimply does not have the resources to participate in the armour race. We should instead focus on how to counteract the presence of armour. If we cannot join them, then shoot them dead."

 ETH_oletta_school:0 "Expand the Oletta School"
 ETH_oletta_school_desc:0 "The Oletta Cadet School has finally had its first graduates, and we can proudly state that the experiment has been a success. These young leaders of Ethiopia have already proven themselves as new thinkers, ready to think and act in ways that our old guard never would. The time has come to end the old ways, and schools such as Oletta will greatly expediate this process."
 ETH_axis_tech:0 "Technological Access"
 ETH_axis_tech_desc:0 "Now that we have joined together with another power to take on the world, we need to have the  ability to actually do so. Luckily. our allies seem willing to cooperate with us on this matter."

 ETH_eritrean_industry:0 "Build Up Eritrean Industry"
 ETH_eritrean_industry_desc:0 "For all their claims of uplifting the Africans, the Europeans have really done a shoddy job of actually bringing real industry to the continent. It now lies to us to show the Eritreans proper industry."
 ETH_somalian_industry:0 "Bring Industry to Somalia"
 ETH_somalian_industry_desc:0 "Somalia has been almost cruelly left behind when it comes to industrial advances. Ever since their conquest by Italy, the region has essentially been a dead zone outside of a few key cities. We aim to change this. Industry will come to Somalia."

 DARK_eth.1.desc:0 "The war is over. We have failed. [ETH.GetNameDef] has once again driven us from their lands, and this time they did not stop at their borders, driving us out of The Horn of Africa completely. Despite our government's best attempts to whip up support for continuing the war, it has become increasingly obvious that the people will no longer support any war efforts, and with no land left to launch an attack from, we have little choice but to sue for peace."
 DARK_eth.1.a:0 "Damn the sons of Menelik!"
    DARK_eth.2.t:0 "Peace With [From.GetNameDef]"
    DARK_eth.2.desc:0 "We have won the war. Driven from their shores, the [ITA.GetAdjective]s have approached us asking for peace. As our people celebrate in the streets, we must decide on the peace deal. We will no doubt receive Eritrea, so long ago taken from us, but do we push [ITA.GetNameDef] for Somalia as well? It may draw unwanted global attention, but surely we deserve it for so soundly beating the [ITA.GetAdjective]s?"

No, the [ETH.GetAdjective]s demand that we return the province of Eritrea to them. Many have protested this demand vehemently, but no-one can deny that [ETH.GetNameDef] essentially controls Eritrea right now, and our protests stand impotent when we cannot back them up. Realistically we have no foreign support when the demand is so relatively small. We have no choice but to accept."

Debate still rages in our country whether this outcome stemmed from [From.GetNameDef]'s weakness or [ETH.GetNameDef]'s strength. Regardless, [From.GetNameDef] has approached us in regards to the peace talks with [ETH.GetNameDef]. It appears that [ETH.GetNameDef] has demanded that [From.GetNameDef] transfer control of both their Eritrean and Somali territories. The [ITA.GetAdjective]s have turned to us to try and get a mediation that would prevent this outcome. Public opinion is on the side of the [ETH.GetAdjective]s, but can we really risk an ascendant [ETH.GetName]?"

At first they assumed they were acting alone, but further talks with the official [ETH.GetAdjective] government in Addis Abba has proven that the delegation was indeed following their government's wishes. Our people would not want a war, but can we really let his blatant disregard for the internaitonal rule of law to stand? Especially from a country like [ETH.GetNameDef]?"

Unfortunately, the [ETH.GetAdjective]s called their bluff and now we stand without any legs to support us. Even if we were to try and refuse the treaty with [ETH.GetNameDef], it would not change the reality of the situation on the ground. We have no choice but to give in to [ETH.GetAdjective]."

It all came to a head when King Victor Emmanuel demanded that [ITA.GetNameDef] make peace. When [ITA.GetLeader] refused, Victor Emmanuel revoked his position of Prime Minister.

Demonstrations had been held for weeks in the streets of the country demanding his removal, many of which were broken up by the infamous blackshirts. Last week, Victor Emmanuel III, King of Italy apparently made an ultimatum to the fascist government that told them to fix the current situation, or he would personally dismiss the government. Rather than give up power, the fascists instead seem bent on continuing their rule by force. King Victor Emmanuel III now leads the opposition to overthrow the fascists and restore democratic rule to Italy. Experts report that the King currently holds the advantage, but that the tenacity of the fascists should not be underestimated."
