MARPAC_resolution_130:0 "§RResolution 130§!: Unification of China Post-Japanese Defeat\n\nProposed by: §G[CHI.GetName]§!\n\nIn the wake of the defeat of the Japanese, China stands at a crucial crossroads. The Nationalist government, under the leadership of §G[CHI.GetLeader]§!, recognizes the urgent need to unify the nation to ensure stability, peace, and prosperity for all its citizens. The era of fragmentation and regionalism must come to an end, and a unified China must rise from the ashes of war. The Nationalist government proposes a bold and historic resolution to all warlords within China: align yourselves with the Nationalists and contribute to the creation of a strong, centralized state. This resolution calls for the warlords to pledge their allegiance to the Nationalist government, thereby becoming part of a unified China. In doing so, they will become puppets of Nationalist China, losing their autonomy but gaining the opportunity to be part of a greater national project. The stakes are high. Accepting this proposal means contributing to the unification and stabilization of China, securing a place in the history of a rejuvenated nation. However, denial of this proposal will be interpreted as an act of war, a declaration that places the warlords in direct opposition to the national interest. The §G[CHI.GetName]§Y calls upon all Chinese warlords to cast their votes on this resolution. This is a pivotal moment that will determine the future of China. By aligning with the Nationalists, the warlords have the chance to be part of a unified, prosperous, and strong China. The Nationalist government stands ready to lead the nation towards a brighter future, but this can only be achieved with the cooperation and support of all regional powers. Therefore, it is proposed that all Chinese warlords decide whether to side with the Nationalist government and support the vision of a unified Chinese state, or face the consequences of being seen as enemies of the nation. The §G[CHI.GetName]§Y proposes to all Chinese warlords to align with the Nationalist government and support the unified Chinese state, ensuring peace, stability, and prosperity for all."
MARPAC_resolution_50:0 "§RResolution 50§!: Preemptive Strike Against Monarchist Germany\n\nProposed by: §G[ENG.GetName]§!\n\nDuring the interwar period, Germany has undergone a significant political transformation, reestablishing a monarchist regime that now threatens the balance of power in Europe. The newly formed monarchist Germany, under the leadership of §G[GER.GetLeader]§, has exhibited aggressive intentions and is poised to initiate military invasions of neighboring states, disrupting peace and stability across the continent.In light of this imminent threat, the §YEuropean Council§Y is asked to consider a preemptive strike against Germany to neutralize this growing danger before it can manifest into a full-scale conflict. This resolution calls for a coalition of European powers to act swiftly and decisively, launching a coordinated military effort to dismantle the monarchist regime and restore order in Germany.The stakes are exceptionally high. Failure to act could result in widespread devastation as Germany embarks on its expansionist agenda, potentially drawing the entire continent into a prolonged and destructive war. A preemptive strike, though fraught with risks, represents the most viable option to safeguard European stability and prevent a larger, more catastrophic conflict.The §G[ENG.GetName]§Y calls upon all member states of the European Council to deliberate on this resolution. This is a critical juncture for Europe, where the actions taken today will shape the continent's future. By supporting this resolution, member states commit to a united front against aggression, prioritizing collective security over individual interests.Therefore, it is proposed that the European Council endorse a preemptive military intervention against monarchist Germany. Accepting this proposal will initiate a concerted effort to neutralize the threat and preserve peace in Europe. Rejection, however, will leave the continent vulnerable to Germany's ambitions, risking widespread conflict and instability.The §G[ENG.GetName]§Y proposes to the §YEuropean Council§Y to support and execute a preemptive strike against monarchist Germany, ensuring the protection of European peace, stability, and security."
