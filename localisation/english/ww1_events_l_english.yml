 ww1_generic.2.t:0 "Pacifist protests"
 ww1_generic.2.d:0 "The movement of pacifists demanding an immediate end to the bloody war is gaining strength in [Root.GetNameDef]. Millions of soldiers have already died in a brutal slog, and the population of our country has increasingly made itself clear that it is against this offensive war.\n\nLeftist and communist movements are using this to their advantage, making it known that they would somehow make everything better, and to our disbelief the people are listening. This has become a dangerous threat to the stability of the state. We must to take measures to restore our depleted lines on the front and simultaneously maintain stability at home in order to reduce the risk of new pacifist protests."

 ww1_generic.3.d:0 "Dissatisfied with working conditions, disgruntled workers have organized a protest march which is gaining more and more people every minute it is allowed to continue.

 ww1_generic.5.t:0 "Mass riots"
 ww1_generic.5.d:0 "While trying to detain the organisers of the protests through the gendarmerie, a call rang out for massive demonstrations across the nation, and it was answered much to our chagrin. The demonstrations quickly turned into riots, and the riots began to get violent. The gendarmerie proceeded to fire on the rioters, leading to a horrid bloodbath and unecessary carnage. These turn of events have revealed to the people that their government no longer represents their best interests, which is something that we fear we cannot redeem ourselves from. These petty demonstrations are now threatening the very heart of our nation."

 ww1_generic.8.t:0 "The Great War: Conference"
 ww1_generic.8.d:0 "The war is over. Peace is here, but at what cost? The lives of our brothers, fathers, and sons can never be brought back, but we can extract other consessions to hope to make up for them. The armistice is signed, and we intend on taking everything we can from the losers. Our enemies will rue the day they met the might of [Root.GetNameDef] and failed to meet the challenge. \n\n In this mod there is a truce that occurs that will establish a series of events that distribute land based on claims and cores. Disabling the Truce will affect the occuerence of events related to the consequences of the defeat of the opposing faction."

 ww1_generic.9.d:0 "The Influenza epidemic has struck, caused by unsanitary conditions during the Great War. It has found roots in [Root.GetNameDef], and we are paying the toll. Medical facilities are sounding the alarm, pleading for help. We haven't been confronted with an epidemic of this size in hundreds of years, and we aren't prepared to deal with it. There is a shortage of drugs and other medicinal equipment, hospitals are crowded beyond anything ever seen, and there aren't enough medical personnel to help everyone.\n\nThe origin of the virus is unknown as of now, but we do know it's everywhere. Countries currently at war cannot bear both the epidemic and their military's cohesion, and as such their fronts are breaking down into trenches full of disease ridden men, calling for their mothers."
 ww1_generic.9.a:0 "God has left us."
 ww1_generic.10.t:0 "Influenza Pandemic"
 ww1_generic.10.d:0 "Influenza H1N1 virus spreads like wildfire. Due to the terrible unsanitary conditions in the trenches during the Great War, the epidemic has infected thousands of soldiers and is on its way to consume the battlefield. The homefront has it worse, with astronomical infection rates and enough death to satisfy the devil.\n\nMaybe we are being punished for our hubris, maybe we shouldn't have played god over our fellow man. Maybe the evil deeds we did in order to secure the petty thing called influence is coming back to haunt us, and maybe we deserve it all. We mustn't linger on such things however, we need to fight back against influenza lest our wars become meaningless because there is nothing left to fight for."

 ww1_generic.13.d:0 "Humanity is faced with an unknown enemy. Giant steel cars are descending from the heavens on the territory of Bohemia and have began to exterminate the local population. Neighboring states also reported that aliens invaded their territory and have called for an international effor to save their nations from desolation by the unknown menace.s\n\nHumanity will never be the same; it may disappear entirely altogether."

 ww1_generic.15.t:0 "Comet Sighted"
 ww1_generic.15.d:0 "Halley's Comet is taking another pass by Earth, as predicted by our finest astronomers. Every 75 years, this celestial body has marked the beginning of disasters and as such has scared superstitious folk, but modern society seeks to study this cosmic phenomenon instead of fearing it. Modern observatories and cameras will allow our scientiest to create high-quality images of the comet for the general public and scientific study."

 ww1_generic.16.t:0 "Farm Crisis"

 ww1_generic.17.t:0 "The Great Depression"
 ww1_generic.17.d:0 "The world feels like its coming to an end. After a colossal stock market crash, the global economy has crumbled to a shadow of its former self. Industrial centers are going bankrupt, banks are closed, and citizens across the globe are being laid off at a rate previously unheard of. Crowds of the recently unemployed occupy the streets of the big cities around the world. The industrial might of [USA.GetName] was particularly affected by the economic shock.\n\nWe need to act now as the situation can only get worse if we don't take the necessary steps to stabilize the economy. The coming years are going to be tough, but we need to push on."
 ww1_generic.17.a:0 "This is so sad."
 ww1_generic.17.b:0 "The end of the capitalist world."
 ww1_generic.18.t:0 "Great Depression in [ROOT.GetNameDef]"

 ww1_generic.26.t:0 "Fraternization with the Enemy!"
 ww1_generic.26.d:0 "Some of our military units have voluntarily ceased hostilities. It is getting increasingly difficult for soldiers and their commanders to endure this war and at the same time maintain their humanity, or what they have left of it. They seek a single respite in walking across the killing field and shaking the hand of their brother. While admirable, war is no time for fraternization. Such acts of comradery with the enemy undermine discipline and reduce our soldiers' willingness to support the state. Even through the immense gunfire, artillery shells, and rotting corpses that devastate the landscape, these men have broken the nationalist barrier that seperates them. They now see each other not as enemies, but as friends, nay, even the same. It is a shame that they will kill each other the next day anyways."

This Pan-Germanic uprising is a surprise to spectators around the world, who didn't realize that there was a yearning for a continued campaign of German Unification. It appears that 1871 did not mark the end of the Germanic people's quest for a united state. So Austria rises, and organizes to join their brothers once and for all."

Discontent among the middle-ranking officers and men for the campaign's conduct by the royal government boiled over into armed revolt led by pro-Venizelist and anti-royalist officers, most notably Nikolaos Plastiras and Stylianos Gonatas.

The Revolutionary Government proclaimed elections to be held for a National Assembly which would decide on the country's future form of government. However, the government had passed an electoral law which heavily favoured the Venizelist Liberal Party and the other anti-monarchist parties. \nThe prospect of the elections and an almost-certain regime change led to the creation of a heterogeneous coalition in the ranks of the army, which aimed to overthrow the government. Its main driving force was the so-called "Majors' Organization" of royalist middle-ranking officers, which was in close contact with the royalist former Deputy Chief of the Army General Staff, General Ioannis Metaxas, but several disgruntled Venizelists, most prominently Leonardopoulos and Gargalidis, also joined. The conspirators managed to win over the bulk of the military units in northern Greece and the Peloponnese, but failed to make inroads in the garrisons of Athens, Thessaloniki or the other major cities, as well as in the overwhelmingly Venizelist Navy. \nIt was launched in the provinces in the early hours of today. In its initial stages it proved rapidly successful: by the morning, in the entire Greek mainland, only the cities of Athens, Thessaloniki, Larissa and Ioannina remained under government control."

I was walking as a dead man without knowing where I was going. Suddenly by turning my head I saw behind me the King with his adjutant. I slowed my pace. The King walked by me, very close to me. I let him walk by me and immediately, I fired. ... I am not an anarchist, but socialist. I become a socialist, when I was studying medicine in Athens. I do not know how.

Cixi quickly organized a coup, and all depended on the decision of Yuan Shikai, who controlled the Beiyang Army. Although once a reformist ally, once again, Yuan Shikai switched sides, supporting Cixi coup the government, capturing most reformers and taking all power away from the emperor. Kang Youwei escaped to Canada.\n\nAfter executing the captured reformers, most intellectuals in the country turned against the government to the revolutionaries, believing our government hopeless.

This conflict, decades in the making, is the result of decades of political tension between the established great powers of Europe and their different goals and ambitions.

This exacerbated the deteriorating relationship between the politicians and the military, who felt the politicians were to blame. The military at first planned to install a new government led by General Francisco Aguilera, president of the Supreme Council of Military Justice, but they ultimately chose Primo de Rivera to lead this new government.\nPrimo de Rivera staged a successful coup d’état in Barcelona in the mould of 19th-century pronunciamientos. With the army's support, he ousted the parliamentary government of Manuel García Prieto. Primo de Rivera stated he would create a temporary government to save Spain from the corrupt politicians that had been mismanaging it since 1898. Shortly after, on 14 September, King Alfonso XIII declared his support for Primo de Rivera's coup and dismissed the civilian government, suspending the 1876 Spanish constitution.

As you can see, the Qing content still hasn't been properly reworked, and the KMT and Federalists don't yet have their own unique focus tree, but it seems to be fun to play as one of the few unique content that can be played through the 1920s in TGWR.\nThe Chinese Warlord Era is a fascinating time period with many stories and characters, just like the Romance of the Three Kingdoms.
