Already in 1912 he was formally commissioned in both the army and navy as a second lieutenant and ensign, respectively, and was also decorated with the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Chrysanthemum. In 1914, he was promoted to the ranks of lieutenant in the army and sub-lieutenant in the navy, then to captain and lieutenant in 1916. He was formally proclaimed Crown Prince and heir apparent on 2 November 1916.\nUpon his father Yoshihito's death on 25th December 1926 he became 124th Emperor of Japan according to the traditional order of succession.\nThe first part of Hirohito's reign took place against a background of financial crisis and increasing military power within the government, through both legal and extralegal means, which futher escalated by the assassination of moderate Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi in 1932, which marked the end of civilian control of the military.\nStarting from the Mukden Incident in 1931, Japan occupied Chinese territories and established puppet governments in Manchuria and Mengkukuo. From that moment further hostilities towards Asian nations are prepared with a Hirohito's blessing - and only time will show if full scale war will ignite as all the armed conflict are mere 'incidents' for the godly Emperor."

These early plans varied greatly in armament, propulsion, endurance, and armor. Main batteries fluctuated between 460 mm (18.1 in) and 406 mm (16 in) guns, while the secondary armaments were composed of differing numbers of 155 mm (6.1 in), 127 mm (5 in), and 25 mm (1 in) guns. Propulsion in most of the designs was a hybrid diesel-turbine combination, though one relied solely on diesel and another planned for only turbines. Endurance in the designs had, at 18 knots (33 km/h; 21 mph), a low of 6,000 nautical miles (11,000 km; 6,900 mi) in design A-140-J2 to a high of 9,200 nmi (17,000 km; 10,600 mi) in designs A-140A and A-140-B2. Armor varied between providing protection from the fire of 406 mm guns to enough protection against 460 mm guns.\n\nYamato is seen as the epitome of Imperial Japanese naval engineering. In addition, Yamato, together with Musashi, due to their size, speed, and power, visibly embodie Japan's determination and readiness to defend its interests against the western powers, especially the United States."
