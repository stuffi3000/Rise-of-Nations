Research and development constitutes the first stage of development of a potential new service or the production process. R&D activities differ from institution to institution, with two primary models[1] of an R&D department either staffed by engineers and tasked with directly developing new products, or staffed with industrial scientists and tasked with applied research in scientific or technological fields, which may facilitate future product development. R&D differs from the vast majority of corporate activities in that it is not intended to yield immediate profit, and generally carries greater risk and an uncertain return on investment. However R&D is crucial for acquiring larger shares of the market through the marketisation of new products."

change_era.4.d:0 "A financial crisis is any of a broad variety of situations in which some financial assets suddenly lose a large part of their nominal value. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, many financial crises were associated with banking panics, and many recessions coincided with these panics. Other situations that are often called financial crises include stock market crashes and the bursting of other financial bubbles, currency crises, and sovereign defaults. Financial crises directly result in a loss of paper wealth but do not necessarily result in significant changes in the real economy (e.g. the crisis resulting from the famous tulip mania bubble in the 17th century). Many economists have offered theories about how financial crises develop and how they could be prevented. There is no consensus, however, and financial crises continue to occur from time to time."

 power_status.1.desc:0 "Global politics, also known as world politics, names both the discipline that studies the political and economic patterns of the world and the field that is being studied. At the centre of that field are the different processes of political globalization in relation to questions of social power. The discipline studies the relationships between cities, nation-states, shell-states, multinational corporations, non-governmental organizations and international organizations. Current areas of discussion include national and ethnic conflict regulation, democracy and the politics of national self-determination, globalization and its relationship to democracy, conflict and peace studies, comparative politics, political economy, and the international political economy of the environment. One important area of global politics is contestation in the global political sphere over legitimacy. Global politics is said by some to be distinct from the field of international politics (commonly seen as a branch of international relations), as it 'does not stress the primacy of intergovernmental relations and transactions'. This distinction however has not always been held among authors and political scientists, who often use the term 'international politics' to mean global politics."

 power_status.2.desc:0 "Global politics, also known as world politics, names both the discipline that studies the political and economic patterns of the world and the field that is being studied. At the centre of that field are the different processes of political globalization in relation to questions of social power. The discipline studies the relationships between cities, nation-states, shell-states, multinational corporations, non-governmental organizations and international organizations. Current areas of discussion include national and ethnic conflict regulation, democracy and the politics of national self-determination, globalization and its relationship to democracy, conflict and peace studies, comparative politics, political economy, and the international political economy of the environment. One important area of global politics is contestation in the global political sphere over legitimacy. Global politics is said by some to be distinct from the field of international politics (commonly seen as a branch of international relations), as it 'does not stress the primacy of intergovernmental relations and transactions'. This distinction however has not always been held among authors and political scientists, who often use the term 'international politics' to mean global politics."

The province as it exists today was created in 1926 after an administrative reorganization of the Kingdom of Italy, and was incorporated together with the province of Trento into the newly created region of Venezia Tridentina ('Trentine Venetia').\n \nThe subsequent alliance between Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini declared that South Tyrol would not follow the destiny of Austria, which had been annexed to the Third Reich. Instead the dictators agreed that the German-speaking population be transferred to German-ruled territory or dispersed around Italy, but the outbreak of the Second World War prevented them from fully carrying out their intention. Every single citizen had the free choice to stay in fascist Italy and to give up his German culture and identity or to move to Nazi Germany to continue living his culture with his identity, but to leave his homeland. The result was that in these difficult times of fascism, the individual South Tyrolean families were divided and separated.\n \nIn 1943, when the Italian government signed an armistice with the Allies, the region was occupied by Germany, which reorganised it as the Operation Zone of the Alpine Foothills and put it under the administration of Gauleiter Franz Hofer. The region was de facto annexed to the German Reich (with the addition of the province of Belluno) until the end of the war.

The German leader, Adolf Hitler, 'canceled a major offensive at Kursk after only a week, in part to divert forces to Italy', resulting in a reduction of German strength on the Eastern Front. The collapse of Italy necessitated German troops replacing the Italians in Italy and to a lesser extent the Balkans, resulting in one fifth of the entire German army being diverted from the east to southern Europe, a proportion that would remain until near the end of the war."

ww2news.16.d:0 "Washington, Aug. 14 -- Japan today unconditionally surrendered the hemispheric empire taken by force and held almost intact for more than two years against the rising power of the United States and its Allies in the Pacific war. The bloody dream of the Japanese military caste vanished in the text of a note to the Four Powers accepting the terms of the Potsdam Declaration of July 26, 1945, which amplified the Cairo Declaration of 1943. Like the previous items in the surrender correspondence, today's Japanese document was forwarded through the Swiss Foreign Office at Berne and the Swiss Legation in Washington. The note of total capitulation was delivered to the State Department by the Legation Charge d'Affaires at 6.10 P. M., after the third and most anxious day of waiting on Tokyo, the anxiety intensified by several premature or false reports of the finale of World War II."

Truman called again for Japan's surrender, warning them to 'expect a rain of ruin from the air, the like of which has never been seen on this earth.' Late in the evening of August 8, 1945, in accordance with the Yalta agreements, but in violation of the Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact, the Soviet Union declared war on Japan, and soon after midnight on August 9, 1945, the Soviet Union invaded the Imperial Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo. Later in the day, the United States dropped a second atomic bomb, this time on the Japanese city of Nagasaki. Following these events, Emperor Hirohito intervened and ordered the Supreme Council for the Direction of the War to accept the terms the Allies had set down in the Potsdam Declaration for ending the war. After several more days of behind-the-scenes negotiations and a failed coup d'état, Emperor Hirohito gave a recorded radio address across the Empire on August 15. In the radio address, called the Jewel Voice Broadcast, he announced the surrender of Japan to the Allies."

By this time France's own demands for rearmament prohibited further development.\n\nIn August and September 1939, as a stopgap measure, forty-one R 35s were supplied to the Royal Romanian Army. These tanks served as the principal tank of the newly-formed 2nd Armoured Regiment. At the end of September 1939, an additional thirty-four brand new R 35s passed into Romanian hands when the Polish 21st Light Tank Battalion (Batalion Czolgów Lekkich,or BCL) chose internment over capture following the German conquest of Poland.

He promptly retired 80 superior officers, considered incompetent or men of the former regime, with another 84 soon following.\n\nHe also began a reorganization of the army according to German military doctrine, and adopted an increasingly harsher attitude towards the legionnaire propaganda in the army, forbidding the officers and NCOs to get involved in politics. The swift measures taken by a military mind halted the decline of both army morale and organization. But more needed to be done to help it recover its prestige."

Antonescu accepted on 31 July. In fact the Romanian Third Army had already crossed the Dnester on 17 July.\n\nThe Siege of Odessa was part of the Eastern Front area of operations and was primarily conducted by Romanian forces and elements of the German Army's 11th Army. Due to the heavy resistance of the Soviet 9th Independent Army and the rapidly formed Separate Coastal Army, which consisted of the Coastal Group of the 9th Army and the Black Sea Fleet forces in Odessa, it took the Romanian army 73 days of siege and four attempts to take the city, during which they suffered 93,000 casualties."

Although the government did not expect bids from its own aircraft industry, IAR company produced several prototype fighters in response to the tender. \n\nNone of the other Romanian companies entered a bid, and as the industry was rife with corruption, the government nationalized IAR while the other two companies were left to their own devices.\n\nThe IAR80 prototype has an open cockpit and it's using a 870 HP IAR K14-III C32 engine, which is a licensed Gnome-Rhône 14K II Mistral Major.\n\nThe model can be improved if we accept to fund the project."

The ARR was impressed and ordered 100 of the new fighters on 18 December 1939, while orders for additional German He 112s beyond the original 30 were cancelled."

Polish-Romanian political relations were initiated on 3 March 1921 by a treaty of friendship and cooperation that both countries pledged To provide mutual help in case one of them would be attacked, without provocation, on their part on their common borders in the east."\n\nOnce one of the Contracting States would be attacked, in terms of constituting a casus foederis,in accordance with provisions established between the two states, the co-signing State shall have the obligation to enact immediate mobilization as well. Between 1921 and 1931 there were numerous meetings to establish the concrete modalities of action of the Polish-Romanian forces to repel an attack from the east."

 romania.26.t:0 "Economic Agreement with Germany"
 romania.26.d:0 "After Titulescu's removal, an improvement in the relationship with Germany was necessary due to it's significant rise of power while French influence was constantly fading.\n\nThe Pro-German policy of Romania’s allies, Poland and Yugoslavia, was another reason for this new orientation. Romania’s economic relation with Germany was very much in Romania’s favour. It provided a market for its agricultural products, a source of advanced technology that allowed a modernization of industry, and an alternative armament supplier.\n\nThe economic agreement of December 1937 that led to an enhancement of economic trade showed the important place that Germany had gained in the Romanian economy."

 romania.27.t:0 "Germany takes over Austrian businesses"
 romania.27.d:0 "The Anschluss conferred on the Reich the economic domination and a strategic position in Central and South-Eastern Europe. Germany took over all the Austrian businesses in Romania.\n\nThe 1934 German economic strategy, the Schacht Plan, introducing a new currency-control regime and German bilateral economic relations with the countries producing raw materials based on compensation arrangements, would soon be replaced by a New Plan, stipulating the concept of multilateral trade agreements and allowing the exchange of goods with countries with complementary economies.\n\nThe advantage for Romania would be that the New Plan was to provide a market for exported products at higher prices than those prevailing on world markets. And Romanian food products were to be exchanged for German industrial goods."

 romania.28.t:0 "Titulescu Removed"
 romania.28.d:0 "In June 1936, Foreign Affairs Minister Nicolae Titulescu famously reacted to the buffoonery exhibited by the Italian journalists when Emperor Haile Selassie I spoke to the League after Ethiopia had been invaded and occupied by Fascist Italy. He jumped to his feet and shouted: A la porte les sauvages!\n\nLater in 1936, under pro-Nazi parties pressure, King Carol II removed Titulescu from all official positions, asking him to leave the country.\nSettling first in Switzerland, he later moved to France.\n\nWhile in exile, Nicolae Titulescu continued through conferences and newspaper articles to propagate the idea of the preservation of peace, perceiving the danger of a war that was to come all too soon after. He returned to Romania in November 1937, partly through the efforts of Iuliu Maniu."

 romania.29.t:0 "Octavian Goga forms a Government"
 romania.29.d:0 "After the elections, King Carol II used the pretext that no party was able to get a majority of 40%, and nominated Octavian Goga, the president of the National-Christian Party, as Prime Minister, asking him to form a government, although his party received less than 10% of the votes. This was only the first step in the royal dictatorship.\n\nIn doing so, the king placed several hits to the PNT party and its leader, Iuliu Maniu. PNT was to be removed from its succession, although it did receive double the amount of PNC's votes, the head of the government was to be an old, determined political adversary of Maniu, and several key members of PNT were to be lured to the king's side, including the newly appointed Minister of Interior, Armand Calinescu."

 romania.30.t:0 "Carol II's Personal Authority Regime"
 romania.30.d:0 "The beginning of 1938 faced a rise of the Iron Guard, which was fiercely attacking the regime ruling the country in order to shift Romania's foreign policy towards the Berlin - Rome Axis.\nMoreover, Prime-minister Goga wanted to win the elections in March 1938 and therefore negotiated a secret agreement with Corneliu Codreanu. Democratic forces were confused and confusing, which enabled Carol II to intervene decisively and achieve his political objective.\n\nBy the coup of February 10, 1938, Carol dismissed Goga of the Council of Ministers and triggered the creation of a government headed by Patriarch Miron Cristea.\nThe 1923 Constitution was suspended and a new fundamental law was hastly developed and promulgated on February 27, 1938, giving the king broad executive and legislative powers.\n\nBy these acts, the monarchy ensured its dominance over the country's political scene, subordinating state institutions to Carol II's will."
 romania.30.a:0 "That can't be good."
 romania.31.t:0 "Suppression of the Legionary"
 romania.31.d:0 "Availing itself of the uncertain internal political climate as well as of the favourable international support of Germany and Italy, the Iron Guard increased it's pressure upon Romanian authorities through large scale public manifestations.\n\nFurthermore, on November 24th, 1938 during an official visit to Berlin, King Carol II was bluntly approached by Hitler relating to the immediate release from prison of Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, the leader of the Iron Guard, and to the Romanian alignment to Axis international policies.\n\nThe King perceived the Legionary Movement as a threat, then more than ever, and as a result, during the night of 29-30 November 1938, Codreanu and 13 others were killed while allegedly trying to escape from prison. A systematic campaign of the authorities for the dismantling of the Legion was initiated."
 romania.31.a:0 "Their radicalism is a threat."
 romania.32.t:0 "Storm Clouds Gather"
 romania.32.d:0 "With their new orientation in foreign policy towards Germany, Romanian politicians cherished the illusion that Romania could secure Berlin's support for defending the territorial integrity of the country.\nSuch hopes would soon be proven not only illusory, but also dangerous for the country's future.\n\nThe German government's response, handed by Ambassador W. Fabricius on June 2nd, 1940, meant a terrible disappointment for the Romanian government circles.\n\nIt clearly showed that Nazi Germany was not interested in maintaining Romania's territorial status-quo and unwilling to take commitments in this regard. Any close "friendly cooperation" with Romania was conditioned by its willingness to act on a definitive settlement of the Balkan sphere.\n\nThe issue whether and to what extent the Romanian government is willing to negotiate a border revision request of its neighbors was now openly approached by the Reich."

Calinescu continued the traditional Romanian policy of close relations with France and the United Kingdom and was to be the one to allow the Polish government, army and refugees to seek shelter on Romanian soil, much against Germany's protests."

Although on September 7 Romania declared its neutrality in the conflict, it did allow passage of war materials aimed to reinforce Polish positions, and on September 13, the Polish National Treasury, estimated at about 45 million dollars, also received clearance to transit Romanian soil on its way towards France.\n\nTogether with the Treasury, about 50,000 Poles have gone to Romania to save their lives and seek refuge from which to resume the fight for homeland defense. Furthermore, on September 17, the Polish Government sought refuge in Romania as well. Acknowledging the futility of the defensive-alliance clause, the Poles released Romania of its obligation to declare war on the Soviet Union, which was already advancing deep in Polish territory."

France supported the alliance by signing treaties with each member country.\n\nIt was thus stated that in the event of an unprovoked attack employed by Hungary against a certain stipulator other parties should provide mutual assistance. In addition, the treaties defined the mutual assistance via a special military convention which was to be signed.\nUntil such a convention came into force, interim measures were to be taken.

As it was clear that Great Britain's and France's reaction was far too weak and no substantial military support would be given to Czechoslovakia, Romania was also reluctant to grant support to its ally, in order to avoid a potential war with Germany. As a member of the Little Entente, Romania and Yugoslavia were compelled to offer military support to Czechoslovakia in case of a Hungarian attack but not in case of a German one.\n\nThe Munich Agreement of September 30th, 1938 made Romania once again conclude that it should not count on Western support and convinced it of the necessity of maintaining neutrality between the Great Powers. Also, the Munich Treaty enhanced the economic influence of Germany over the countries in Central and South-Eastern Europe.

Fabricius on June 2nd, 1940, meant a terrible disappointment for the Romanian government circles.\n\nIt clearly showed that Nazi Germany was not interested in maintaining Romania's territorial status-quo and unwilling to take commitments in this regard. Any close friendly cooperation" with Romania was conditioned by its willingness "to act on a definitive settlement of the Balkan sphere".

This attitude generated a division in the Little Entente. Romanian refusal was also due to the fact that the treaty would have given the USSR the right to cross its territory in order to help Czechoslovakia.

In exchange for these concessions, the United States requires us to reach a truce with them. While this may seem like a small price to pay for the benefits we stand to gain, there are also certain risks involved.

Hours after, Kim Il-sung, Kim Won-bong and Kim Jwa-jin announced by radio that the only way to save the nation was through an anarchist government.

Lee Beom-seok reported that he was attacked by Kim Chaek in his way home, he also said that he was very lucky and would probably be dead if the man's gun didn't jammed. However, the assassin managed to scape before Lee had the opportunity to shoot back. Now general Hong Beom-do is being transported to Seoul hospital, before entering the ambulance which he stated that he was fine and it would take more than two traitors to take him down. Finally, Hong Beom-do assured the press that the junta now has the duty to execute all the generals who collaborated in the plot."

kor.6.d:0 "The military junta of Korea decided that the best way to assure the stability of Korea is by restoring the Korean throne. However, a big problem remains about who should be the new leader of the Korean nation. \n\nIn one hand, Yi Kang is the eldest song of emperor Gojong, nonetheless he was born by Lady Jang, a court lady-in-waiting of King Gojong, not the king's official consort or concubine, therefore having a king with that lineage would be humillating for our population. \n\nIn the other hand there's Yi Un, son of Emperor Gojong and Imperial Noble Consort Sunheon, who would be the perfect option if it wasn't for the fact that he was the protégé of emperor Meiji himself, and was a general of the Japanese army."

But it was empty. The only thing they found was a book with a note over its cover, which said "The war is lost.

chi.37.b:0 "Zhao Hengti, the federalist general!"
chi.38.d:0 "Today the Chinese government approached us with a deal: Creating an autonomous region controlled by China in our treaty port, region which will grant military access to our army and navy. This might be a benefit if we think about the fact that China would be able to help us protect the ports from our enemies, but in the other hand it might just be a trick... How should we respond?"
chi.38.a:0 "Seems like a fair proposition."
chi.38.b:0 "They will not dare to take it."
chi.39.d:0 "After the defeat in the Federalist-Guangxi war, Li Zongren, old warlord of the clique, and Bai Chongxi, his most loyal general, crossed our border along with 12000 exhausted and under-equipped soldiers. Long Yun decided to recieve them and integrate them in the army, hoping that they don't aim to cause any problems."
chi.39.a:0 "A free general is a free general."
chi.40.d:0 "Today Ryukichi Tanaka, a Japanese chief of staff and friend of Yan Xishan, met with him in order to convince him to join Japan in an anti-communist alliance. Yan asked to all the Japanese troops to leave Shanxi and a great amount of money in exchange of an alliance, which will be only against the communist governments of China. Now the only thing to do is to wait."
chi.40.a:0 "Maybe we will get something good out of this."
chi.41.d:0 "Ryukichi Tanaka, one of our chief of staff fighting in the Chinese front with Shanxi, came to us with a delegate from Yan Xishan, telling us that after a meeting with the general, he was willing to enact an alliance with us, in exchange of an amount of money and the retreat of our forces from his territory. While it may seem like we would get no benefit from this, not having to care about defending Mengkukuo from the Chinese might free some of our forces, and let us prepare more naval invasions. However, it seems like the general is not very convinced about our intentions, so he might change his mind about joining us, but for the good of his people, it's likely that he would not attack us again in case of enacting a truce with us. How should we respond?."
chi.41.a:0 "It is worth the money."
chi.41.b:0 "A truce would benefit us both."
chi.41.c:0 "We won't negotiate with inferiors."
chi.42.d:0 "To our suprise, the government of Japan accepted our proposal to join their faction, and assured that they would pay the demanded amount of money at the moment we joined them. However, Yan Xishan doesn't seem too convinced, and thinks it is all a trap of the Japanese to take military control of the zone, how should we respond?"
chi.42.a:0 "Better dishonor than death."
chi.42.b:0 "A truce will be enough."
chi.43.d:0 "Today the government of Shanxi asked us for a general to command their forces in order to improve the quality of their army. Some people among our government proposed to send Sadao Araki, the leader of the Kodoha faction, to help them, while others proposed Yoshijiro Umezu, a member of the Toseiha faction. However, we could also just refuse to send any."
chi.43.a:0 "Sadao Araki might help them."
chi.43.b:0 "Yoshijiro Umezu will do a great job."
chi.43.c:0 "Do they think we are a general shop or something?"
chi.44.d:0 "Due to the ever increasing conflicts between the CPC and Shanxi, today a guerrilla force was sent to Taiyuan with the objective of assassinating Yan Xishan and taking control over the region. Fortunately they did not succed in killing him, but they provoked a full scale uprising all over Shanxi, commanded by Zhou Enlai, which after Yan Xishan escaped to Beijing, took power over the clique. After noticing their defeat was evident, the remaining generals scaped to Beijing as well, where they probably would join the Nanjing forces as soon as possible."
chi.44.a:0 "The revolution has succeded!"
chi.45.d:0 "Due to the ever increasing conflicts between the CPC and Shanxi, today a guerrilla force was sent to Taiyuan with the objective of assassinating Yan Xishan and taking control over the region. Fortunately they did not succed in killing him, but they provoked a full scale uprising all over Shanxi, commanded by Zhou Enlai, which after Yan Xishan escaped to Beijing, took power over the clique. After noticing their defeat was evident, the remaining generals scaped to Beijing as well, to then join our forces in Nanjing."
chi.45.a:0 "We will rescue your homes from the claws of the communists, whatever it takes."
chi.46.d:0 "Just like the first coup organized by the Russian Guihua in 1933 against Jin Shuren, the Guihua cavalry corps have taken control over the country to end the tyranny of Sheng Shicai. After succeding at invading the capital and killing the few chinese guards protecting the palace, they captured Sheng Shicai and excecuted him in the streets of Urumqi. Finally, they appointed Ma Shaowu, a renowed general member of the Kuomintang, as the new leader of the nation."
chi.46.a:0 "Will this provoke a second Russian intervention in Xinjiang?"
chi.47.d:0 "Today the government of Sinkiang has arrested our advisors, following their new anti-communist stance. Invading them might seem easy, but at the moment our army is not well supplied and our population would not stand another stalemate like in our intervention in the region in 1934. How should we respond?"
chi.47.a:0 "Let's do this quickly."
chi.47.b:0 "Just issue a diplomatic protest."
chi.48.d:0 "Today Ma Shaowu approached our government with an interesting proposal: Uniting our administrations as well as our armed forces. While it may seem that there are no downsides to this action, maybe it would be better for us to have them as our vassal, instead of a brother..."
chi.48.a:0 "We'll be stronger together."
chi.48.b:0 "We have other plans for Xinjiang..."
chi.49.d:0 "Today the Ma clique approached our government with an interesting proposal: Uniting our administrations as well as our armed forces. While it may provide us protection against Moscow, it would mean to sacrifice our independence."
chi.49.a:0 "We'll be stronger together."
chi.49.b:0 "We appreciate our liberty."
chi.50.d:0 "Early this week, prince Mehmed Abdülkerim Efendi of the Ottoman house arrived Sinkiang to take power of the nation, after being appointed as the new leader by the Guihua corps. Some people among the government began proposing the idea of uniting our nations, so we become stronger and are able to better defend ourselves from the Russians, strategy that obiously would cost part of our autonomy. This decision remains in the king's hands, should we join the new Ottoman Empire?"
chi.50.a:0 "Let's hope it doesn't collapses again."
chi.50.b:0 "What a stupid idea."
chi.51.d:0 "The government of Afganistan congratulated us for the coronation of Mehmed Abdülkerim Efendi, and to celebrate, they proposed a union between our two nations. People was astonished by this proposition, but the sultan along with the Guihua corps decided that it would benefit us both to enact this union."
chi.51.a:0 "The Ottoman Empire grows stronger!"
chi.52.d:0 "Today the government of Sinkiang, now known as the Ottoman Empire, has excecuted our advisors, following their new anti-communist stance. Our people is strongly demanding our government to punish the Ottomans, and not doing so would surely anger them. Nonetheless, the decision remains in our great leader's hands."
chi.52.a:0 "They will regret ever existing!"
chi.52.b:0 "What would we gain from invading a couple of mountains in a desert?."
chi.53.d:0 "Today a delegation from the Russian government of Sinkiang arrived our country with a message they wanted us to keep in secret. White guerrillas are currently preparing a coup in Eastern Russia, taking control of all the states between Kamchatka and Krasnoyarsk. They invite us to join them in their war against Moscow when the revolt ignites, however they have told us that the revolution is still in preparation, but they will notify us 120 days before the coup begins."
chi.53.a:0 "We will take their offer into consideration."
chi.54.d:0 "The Second Russian Civil War began after exiled White Russians and Japanese attaches ignited a revolt in Eastern Russia. Due to our country being currently almost encircled by the White forces, our government has broken our alliances with Moscow to preserve our independence and impede the loss of Mongolian lives in a battle that does not benefit us. However, some people have seen this as an opportunity to occupy Tannu Tuva, while others think that it would just anger the Soviets, provoking them to invade our country."
chi.54.a:0 "Nobody will notice it's gone."
chi.54.b:0 "Let's not take a side in this conflict."
chi.55.d:0 "Today we recieved the message from the White Russian government in Sinkiang, reminding us that they will begin the revolt in exactly 120 days, and that they'd appreciate our support in their operation. Helping them may end up benefiting us, making the newly stablished Russian government more willing to collaborate us in the future, as well as providing us a reliant oil supply, however, nothing assures our win in this war, and most probably the Russian government of Sinkiang will not give us any territories besides Sakhalin, unless of course, we find a way to demand them to do so..."
chi.55.a:0 "Moscow won't be as lucky as in 1922!"
chi.55.b:0 "It's not worth the losses."
chi.56.d:0 "The Japanese government has accepted to support us in our struggle against the government of Moscow. We won't fall this time!"
chi.56.a:0 "Petrograd shall be ours again!"
chi.57.d:0 "The Japanese government has ignored our message inviting them to support us in our struggle against the government of Moscow. However, this won't stop us from reclaiming our homeland."
chi.57.a:0 "We will have to do this alone."
chi.58.d:0 "Now that the war with the government of Moscow has ended, it is time to demand to Russia our deserved compensation for our support in the Second Russian Civil War, but the question is, what should we ask to the Russians?"
chi.58.a:0 "We deserve to hold Eastern Russia!"
chi.58.b:0 "War reparations will be enough."
chi.59.d:0 "Today we recieved a message from Japan demanding us to transfer them control over the states of the Far East in exchange for the support they provided us in the Second Russian Civil War. We are most probably not strong enough to defeat their army, airforce and navy, and we are not in a position to fight another war in Siberia, but abandoning the people who fought for us in the civil war would surely anger our population, and reduce their support to our government."
chi.59.a:0 "We have no option..."
chi.59.b:0 "Maybe they would accept another alternative."
chi.59.c:0 "We will defend our people until the end!"
chi.60.d:0 "Today we recieved a message from Japan demanding us to pay them war reparations in exchange for the support they provided us in the Second Russian Civil War. Currently our economy is not at its best state, but they are threatening us with a declaration of war if we refuse, and we are most probably not strong enough to defeat their army, airforce and navy, and we are not in a position to fight another war in Siberia."
chi.60.a:0 "Well, could be worse..."
chi.60.b:0 "Are they joking?"
chi.61.d:0 "The Russian government answered our ultimatum with an interesting proposal: The creation of a buffer state in the Far East. This newly created country would be de iure an autonomous region of Russia, but would mostly function as a totally independent state. We and the Russians will have military access to it and will also guarantee its independence in case of an attack of a foreign country, or from one of us..."
chi.61.a:0 "Fair enough."
chi.61.b:0 "This is an insult to our nation! Banzai!"
chi.62.d:0 "Now that the government of Moscow is not a menace anymore, it is time to restore the tsardom in Russia, but after the assassination of Nicholas the II's family in the Russian Civil War, many Romanov began claiming the throne. Now we have choose: Shall we crown Kyril Romanov, the admiral, or Dmitri Romanov, the cavalry leader?"
chi.62.a:0 "Kyril Romanov, the admiral!"
chi.62.b:0  "Dmitri Romanov, the dragoon!"
chi.63.d:0 "Now that we have seized control over Stalingrad, it is time to change its name to one which is more according to our current administration."
chi.63.a:0 "Tsaritsyn, like in the old days."

chi.63.c:0 "Vrangelgrad, in honour to Wrangel, the black baron."

chi.64.b:0 "Petrograd, we are not Germans."
chi.64.c:0 "Denikingrad, in honour to Denikin, one of the saviours of Russia!"
chi.65.d:0 "Now that we hold control over Russia, we should begin considering were to locate our capital."
chi.65.a:0 "The north, like in the days of the empire."
chi.65.b:0 "The center, due to its immense population."
chi.65.c:0 "The south, protected by forests and rivers."
chi.66.d:0 "Today, one year after being crowned, Tsar Kyril Romanov passed away, leaving his son, Vladimir Romanov, as the new head of state of Russia."
chi.66.a:0 "Long live the Tsar!"
chi.67.d:0 "Today the Russian government has approached us proposing us joining their sphere of influence in exchange of a great amount of economic investiments. Our country's economy is not currently great, and if we refuse we could easily anger them, but is it worth sacrifying our hardly earned independence?"
chi.67.a:0 "We have no option, don't we?"
chi.67.b:0 "Our freedom is more important."
chi.68.d:0 "Today the Russo-Xinjiang rail building mission finished the Alma-ata-Gansu road, greatly increasing our infrastructure in the region."

They need a Han leadership, they all must follow the Ming. \n\nBut how would he achieve restoring a long time gone dynasty? The answer was simple: the Zhu family. They are the descendants of the Ming dynasty, and it's said that they are raising a kid, who could be easily converted to the Yiguandao to then help them share their beliefs in all of China. \n\nAnd so they did, they crowned Zhu Rongji, who will be turning 16 in 1944, as the new king of China. At first his mother and her family were hesitant about making their child king of China and mistrusted Zhang, but after days trying to convince them of joining the new Fengtian government, they folded.\n\nNow the leader of the Yiguandao only has to get rid of the family, but killing them all but the child would be too obvious, people would begin asking questions and those questions would one day reach Rongji's ears.

Why would some normal criminal go and kill all the family of the king just to steal some gold? It will be never known. \n\nAlthough this is a tragedy, the Chinese people must not worry, king Zhu Rongji lives! He fortunately was with regent Zhang Tianran in a temple while the carnage happened.

He was told that he was being arrested due to an unending amount of crime accusations on him. \n\nThe leader of the Yiguandao freezed for a moment, to then command his guards, who seemed totally overwhelmed, to shot at the coup stagers, but they hesitated. While he looked at the shocked faces of his guards, he heard the sound of a pistol being shot, to then feel an enormous pain in his abdomen. \n\nZhang fell down and began quivering as he felt how life was escaping from his body. "Shoot them!" he babbled, but he heard no response from his guards. "I'll now meet you, eternal mother" he finally said with his last breath. The madness had finally come to an end."
