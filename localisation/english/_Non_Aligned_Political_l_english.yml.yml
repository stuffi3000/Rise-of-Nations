 election.55.t:0 "Election: Unaligned Majority"
 election.55.d:0 "This election has been devastating for the very institution it represents. The majority of the [Root.GetAdjective] population have cast their vote in favor of a unaligned party that seeks to abolish elections and install an autocratic ruler. While many consider taking up arms against this violation of the democratic ideals that allowed them this mandate to begin with, others consider the use of violence to only confirm their ideals further."
 election.55.a:0 "It is a black day for [Root.GetName], but the people have spoken."
 election.55.b:0 "We will not give up our liberty without a fight!"
 political.41.t:0 "Unaligned on the Rise"
 political.41.d:0 "Monarchists rise up against their oppressors around the world, new voices are spreading in the [Root.GetAdjective] unaligned movement. Referring to the rule of [Root.GetRulingParty] as a dictatorship, they have begun calling for it to be brought out of power by any means necessary. Whether those means will come from within or without remains to be seen."
 political.41.a:0 "There may be those in the government itself who support such ideas."
 political.41.a.tt:0 "Increases the chance of internal support for an unaligned coup."
 political.41.b:0 "A movement for the people must seek support from the people."
 political.41.b.tt:0 "Increases the chance of popular support for a unaligned uprising."
 political.29.t:0 "Unaligned Demand Referendum"
 political.29.d:0 "The rapidly growing [Root.GetAdjective] unaligned movement has never claimed that they need majority support before they seize power, counting on uniting the nation under their leadership once their rule is established. However, it seems their public support has grown rapidly. Many unaligned are now calling [Root.GetLeader] a hypocrite, claiming to represent the wishes of the people while in reality turning a deaf ear to the masses.\n\nThe call for a referendum has been dismissed as typical attempts at disrupting the system by [Root.GetRulingParty] members so far, but at least it's a political measure. If we do not act now, the unaligned may choose the violent struggle as a better path to power."
 political.29.a:0 "Suppress this hateful movement!"
 political.29.b:0 "Don't pay any attention to them."
 political.29.c:0 "If the people want it, we'll hold the referendum."
 political.22.t:0 "Unaligned Supporters Rise Up"
 political.38.d:0 "After their request for a referendum was denied, the few reformers of the unaligned movement in [Root.GetName] rapidly lost influence to the more radical elements. With the [Root.GetRulingParty]'s refusal to acknowledge the public support for the suggested reforms, the romantic view of the revolution gradually grew more widespread and the leaders of the movement become those who could most easily start a riot. Those riots have now erupted into a full-scale civil war, with the future of the nation at stake."
 political.38.a:0 "We won't allow them to ruin our country!"
 political.38.b:0 "The fire of the revolution must be extinguished with the blood of the oppressors!"
