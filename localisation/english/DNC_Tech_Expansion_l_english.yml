early_CAS_equipment_1910_desc:0 "First dedicated Close Air Support plane, basically state-of-the-art with what we're working with now, the general design is optimized for engaging enemy (or friendly) ground units. Utilizes more reliable parts, even bigger fuel tanks and more fuel-efficient engine."
early_fighter_equipment_1906_desc:0 "More advancements done on the previous design, has basic rifles attached to its front so there is some attack capability but it's most definitely not the end product."
early_fighter_equipment_1908_desc:0 "Has a bigger engine, bigger fuel tanks, better control surfaces and more advanced rifles than the previous model, what more could we ask for? A lot, actually."

RON_Air_Engine_Improvements_desc:0 "Improved engines used for fighter planes, has better spark timings and uses better parts. Good clean slate for future innovations."
RON_Fighter_1490_desc:0 "The dream of human flight must have begun with observation of birds soaring through the sky. For millennia, however, progress was inefficient by attempts to design aircraft that emulated the beating of a bird’s wings. The generations of experimenters and dreamers who focused their attention on ornithopters—machines in which flapping wings generated both lift and propulsion—contributed nothing substantial to the final solution of the problems blocking the route to mechanical flight."
RON_Fighter_1890_desc:0 "In 1870s first human; Otto Lilienthal finally undertook the challenge of achieving Man's dream of flight by creating many glider and engine-less biplane protoypes and flying over 2,000 flights until his death in 1896"
RON_Fighter_1903_desc:0 ""Wright Flyer - The first powered machine to achieve controlled, sustained flight with a pilot abroad" this is the earliest plane as we know it, and we can only go forward from here."
