In Paris, about 101 hectares, 44 countries offer hundred-four-twenty-ten pavilions around the theme of arts and techniques applied to modern life. Nearly 32 million visitors will rush to come. At the time, Paris will retain the Chaillot Palace, the Palace of discovery, and the Palais de Tokyo. The spirit and the new art triumph everywhere. The world wants to believe for a moment that the exhibition will finally bring together everything that unites men. But strikes the spirits is both monumental Soviet and German pavilions facing to challenge each other: one with a statue of twenty-five metres of Worker and Kolkhoz Woman brandishing a sickle and a hammer; the other by a monumental sculpture of an eagle holding a swastika in its talons."

 FRA_jet_fighter_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Dassault M.D.450 Ouragan was the first French-designed jet fighter-bomber to enter production, playing a key role in resurgence of the French aviation industry after World War II. The Ouragan was operated by France, India, Israel and El Salvador. After the war, aviation designer Marcel Dassault was eager to re-establish the aviation industry with an all-French jet fighter, which was outlined in 1947. The Ouragan was smaller and lighter than the Thunderjet and had a thin wing similar to the one used by the Lockheed F-80 Shooting Star."

During the 1950s, France embarked on an extensive military program to produce nuclear weapons; however, it was acknowledged that existing French aircraft were unsuitable for the task of delivering the weapons themselves. Thus, the development of a supersonic bomber designed to carry out the delivery mission started in 1956 as a part of the wider development of France's independent nuclear deterrent."
