The rapid decline has distracted the Persian nation from adapting its agrarian economy, and with it comes the cost of heavy economic reliance and a lack of infrastructure to industrialise from. And while the Persian army does not suffer from this as much as it logically should due to the military missions sent by the European powers, Persia is left completely vulnerable to invasion due to its lack of an industrial base, even from tribes inside of its borders. The revolutionary instability has already done grave harm to the integrity and glue of the nation, and this lack of centralisation is the cherry on top of Persia's problems."

From what the constitutionalists perceive, Persia had been a nation stuck in time with its reactionary regime opposing all reform. King Mozaffar ad-Din Shah Qajar, the monarch up to 1906, had signed a constitution shortly before his passing. The succession turned to Mohammed Ali Shah, who then went on to abolish the constitution and bomb the parliament building. Pro-constitutional elements then went on to force his abdictation and reestablish the constitution, but not without its harm to the integrity of the nation. After a destabilising civil war and foreign interventions, Persia now stands at the crossroads of history. Facing political decay and disorder, whoever succeeds is completely up to the sands of time."

Persia, if controlled by the British, would expose Russia's underbelly, that is the Caucasus and Central Asia. Were it to be under Russian control, it would cut through the British Empire, exposing Kuwait and Baluchistan. The Persian diplomats, eager to exploit this prospect, wanted to use this cold war to secure Persian independence by playing both sides against each other. This foreign policy strategy, however, failed tremendously, following the softening of relations between the Russian Empire and the British Empire."

After the 1843 Revolution, The term appeared for the first time during the debates of Prime Minister Ioannis Kolettis, leader of the French Party, with King Otto that preceded the promulgation of the 1844 constitution. According to the Megali Idea, the Greek nation must gather up strength to liberate Greek inhabited territories under foreign rule, with its final goal being the liberation of the former Eastern Roman capital, and cultural centre of the Hellenes, Constantinople. When  George I ascended the throne in 1863, the title offered to him by the Greek National Assembly was not "King of Greece", the title of his deposed predecessor, King Otto; but rather "King of the Hellenes". Forward to that, the kingdom saw a rapid expansion over the decades, with the annexation of the Ionian Islands under the Treaty of London in 1864 and the annexation of Thessaly and Arta under the Convention of Constantinople in 1881. The hopes are still high, and the Megali Idea is slowly becoming a concrete reality rather than an ideolized concept."

During the disastrous Greco-Turkish War of 1897, it was with the King’s appeal to the Great Powers that Hellas maintained its independence. The King has reigned over Hellas for almost 50 years and his advanced age has begun catch up to him. As such, Prince Constantine, the King’s Heir, has largely taken up most of his father’s duties as King."
