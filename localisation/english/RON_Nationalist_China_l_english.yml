Wang, a rival of Chiang Kai-shek and member of the pro-peace faction of the KMT, defected to the Japanese side and formed a collaborationist government in occupied Nanking (Nanjing) (the traditional capital of China) in 1940.

Furthermore, the Golden Horn with city and port in Vladivostok could serve us as the naval base for our navy.\n\nThis is a great success for us and all of China and people will surely support our government even more.

However, the real power was in the hands of Chiang Kai-shek, who was in near complete control of the military as the superintendent of the Whampoa Military Academy.\n\nNow, long after its establishment, Kuomintang is interwoven with corruption and mismatch.

He attended university there, but when the Chinese Nationalists violently broke with the Communists, he was sent to work in a steel factory in the Ural Mountains. Chiang Kai-shek refused to negotiate a prisoner swap for his son in exchange for a Chinese Communist Party leader, stating that 'It is not worth it to sacrifice the interest of the country for the sake of my son.'.\n\nHowever now, with our recent rapprochement with Nationalist China, it seems that it would be more profitable to side with the Nationalists over the Communists once again.

Through this he achieved social and economic stability and raised the People's Support for Kuomintang. As soon as these primary goals were achieved he focused on strengthening education and culture, utilizing his knowledge gained in the Soviet Union. That is to be achieved by increasing number of national and junior high schools and by emphasizing policies to eliminate illiterate people. Newspapers and other medias were also to be expanded.\n\nThe key stones of his First Three Year South-South Plan is to to remove feudalism that nests in society, enhance nationalism and improve production skills in carrying out national education based on Sun Yat-sen Three Principles.\n\nHis efforts are being hailed as a miracle in the political war in China and coined as the 'Gannan New Deal', but also critisied by some members of Kuomintang for use of almost-communists methods, saying that 'Chiang Ching-kuo is a real communist and South China is already red'."

 kmt.585.d:0 "FROM: [From.GetName]"
 kmt.585.d_1:0 "Due to the lack of natural barriers in the Macau Peninsula, our forces were quick to occupy the area. Some of the [KMT_defender.GetAdjective] garrisons were able to retreat to Concelho das Ilhas to the south by ferries and had put up improvised coastal defenses.\n\nHowever, they were unable to hold out for long due to shortage of munition and men.\n\nOur forces ultimately defeated the remaining garrisons and took photos with the Ruins of St. Paul's to celebrate their victory."
 kmt.585.d_2:0 "At first, our local garrison in [From.GetName] were ill-prepared for an armed conflict and got pushed back to Concelho das Ilhas located south of the Macau Peninsula rather quickly. They were able to put up improvised coastal defense to deter the rampaging [KMT_attacker.GetAdjective] forces.\n\nAfter being reorganised, our local garrisons were able to launch a counter-offensive and, with their knowledge of the layout of the city, successfully pushed the [KMT_attacker.GetAdjective] forces out of Macau Peninsula. The conflict later came to a stalemate and no further military activities were observed from both side."
 kmt.585.d_3:0 "The [KMT_defender.GetAdjective] garrisons were unable to hold the inland area of the leased territory and retreated to Donghai Island. While costly, our forces were able to establish a beachhead on the northeastern part of Donghai Island and quickly defeated the remaining garrisons."
 kmt.585.d_4:0 "The [KMT_attacker.GetAdjective] forces' initial surprise attack caught our local garrison in [From.GetName] off-guard. However, our forces were able to hold out at Fort Bayard until reinforcements arrived. Seeing that their surprise attack has not achieved anticipated successes, the [KMT_attacker.GetAdjective] forces soon retreated out of [From.GetName] territory."
 kmt.585.d_5:0 "After crossing the Sham Chun River, our forces were able to advance swiftly until Shing Mun Redoubt, where fierce combats took place.\n\nDespite suffering some losses, the occupation of Kowloon was rather swift. However, the [KMT_defender.GetAdjective] garrisons held a strong defensive position on Hong Kong Island and direct assaults had resulted in heavy casualties. A small group of combatants were able to land on the island utilising the nightly darkness. A forward position was soon established, followed by the rapid defeat of the stunned and disorganised garrison."
 kmt.585.d_6:0 "Our local garrisons were able to hold the advancing [KMT_attacker.GetAdjective] forces at Shing Mun Redoubt and near Tide Cove. The intense combats had worn down both sides.\n\nDue to failure in seizing initiatives, the [KMT_attacker.GetAdjective] forces were forced to withdraw and regroup. Further assaults against [Root.GetAdjective] defensive positions were launched but to no avail. The heavy casualties and unfruitful operations eventually lead to the retreat of [KMT_attacker.GetName] forces back to the north of Sham Chun River to avoid potential political pressure."
 kmt.585.d_7:0 "The [KMT_defender.GetAdjective] defenders in the west side of the Kiautschou Bay were quick to surrender after being pushed to Daqiao Island and all retreat routes were denied.\n\nOn the other side of the Kiautchou Bay, the fight in the urban area was a lot fiercer， but in the end we emerged victorious and reclaim the [743.GetName]."
 kmt.585.d_8:0 "Although surprising our local garrisons in [From.GetName] with their attacks, the [KMT_attacker.GetAdjective] forces were unable to penetrate our outer defense.

However, the coastal defense they put up there proved to be very effective. Our forces were unable to establish a forward position there and a counter-offensive soon begun. Our troops quickly retreated to where they started and high command had decided to call the operation off. Luckily the [KMT_defender.GetAdjective] didn't launch further military operation."
 kmt.586.d_2:0 "The [KMT_attacker.GetAdjective] troops strikes our local garrison in [KMT_port.GetName] unexpectedly and soon our men were forced to retreat out of Macau Peninsula down to the southern Concelho das Ilhas. The improvised defensive positions were not enough to deter the [KMT_attacker.GetAdjective] due to the lack of munition and men.\n\n[KMT_port.GetName] is now lost."
 kmt.586.d_3:0 "Despite initial success, our forces were unable to root out the [KMT_defender.GetAdjective] garrisons in Fort Bayard. After observing [KMT_defender.GetAdjective] reinforcements arriving, high command had deemed the mission a failure and ordered our men to retreat outside of [KMT_port.GetName]. The [KMT_defender.GetAdjective] seemed to have little interest to escalate the event further."
 kmt.586.d_4:0 "[KMT_port.GetName]'s inland area became a graveyard of [KMT_defender.GetAdjective] garrisons as they were largely out-numbered by the rampaging [KMT_attacker.GetAdjective] forces. The local garrisons' final stand took place on Donghai Island, where they were able to withstand waves of assault before the [KMT_attacker.GetAdjective] forces established a forward position on the northeastern part of the island. Left with no other options, the local [KMT_defender.GetAdjective] garrisons fled the port on a neutral merchant ship."
 kmt.586.d_5:0 "Advancement through the New territories was rather effortless up until the Battle of Shing Mun Redoubt. Our forces were unable to destroy the position and suffered heavy losses, so does another group that took a detour near Tide Cove. The high death tolls forced our troops to retreat and regroup. Additional assaults were later launched at the positions but remains fruitless. As the operation drags on, high command had cancelled the mission in fear of international pressure.\n\nThe [KMT_defender.GetAdjective] did not attempt a counter-offensive after our troops retreated back to the north of Sham Chun River."
 kmt.586.d_6:0 "Although the local [KMT_defender.GetAdjective] garrisons dealt some blows to the [KMT_attacker.GetAdjective] forces at Shing Mun Redoubt, the position soon fell to [KMT_attacker.GetAdjective] hands due to miscommunication and loose organisation. The remaining garrisons had held a strong position on Hong Kong Island and nullified numerous landing attempt. A small group of [KMT_attacker.GetAdjective] combatants were able to sneak on the island however. Our perplexed troops were caught off-guard, which then soon fell into disarray, and summarily defeated.\n\nWe have lost control over Hong Kong."
 kmt.586.d_7:0 "Even with our initiative, the [KMT_defender.GetAdjective] garrisons in [KMT_port.GetName] had a well-maintained defense and our forces were incapable of penetrating their line. Shocked by the reports, the mission command decided to called it off in a fit. The operation had been covered up as merely an "accident" and a small fund was later administered to the [KMT_port.GetName] as a compensation."
 kmt.586.d_8:0 "Our forces stationed on the west side of Kiautschou Bay were ineffectual in defending their positions against the storming [KMT_attacker.GetAdjective] forces and soon capitulated.\n\nBrutal urban combats had taken place on the other side of the Bay, where our local garrisons fought to the last men.\n\n[KMT_port.GetName] is now in [KMT_attacker.GetAdjective] hands."

 kmt.587.d_1:0 "The Battle of Macau ended with a status quo ante bellum between the [KMT_attacker.GetAdjective] forces and [KMT_defender.GetAdjective] garrisons. As a result of numerous failed amphibious assaults on [KMT_defender.GetAdjective] positions on Taipa and Coloane, and the [KMT_defender.GetAdjective] garrisons' inability to launch a successful counter-offensive to retake Macau Peninsula."
 kmt.587.d_2:0 "With the local [KMT_defender.GetAdjective] garrisons retreated to Donghai Island, the [KMT_attacker.GetAdjective] forces were unable to make further progress. In fear of political pressure, the local commander had secretly signed an armistice and everything returned to the state before the conflict. The insubordinate commander was later tried for his action."
 kmt.587.d_3:0 "Although our forces met little resistance marching through New Territories, the Battle of Shing Mun Redoubt had become a bloodbath. Both side suffered grave losses during the combat. Deeming that the mission had failed, high command contacted the [KMT_port.GetName] local government for a ceasefire and discussed peace terms. The conflict ended with [KMT_attacker.GetAdjective] troops withdrew back to the north of Sham Chun River."
 kmt.587.d_4:0 "After dispatching the [KMT_defender.GetAdjective] garrisons on the west side of Kiautschou Bay, the [KMT_attacker.GetAdjective] on the east side was repelled however. [KMT_defender] garrisons then started commandeered civilian ships to reach the other side of the Bay, only to be greeted by land-based [KMT_attacker.GetAdjective] retaliation. The [KMT_attacker.GetAdjective] forces soon copied the [KMT_defender.GetAdjective]'s methods and battles between soldiers on small ships ensued in the Kiautschou Bay.\n\nThe conflict in fact ended after civilians started to reject commandeering requests and a ceasefire was signed not long after, restoring the state before the conflict."
