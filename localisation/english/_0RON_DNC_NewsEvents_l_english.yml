As a result, its constitutional, legal, linguistic, and cultural legacy is widespread.

The Allied forces consisted of approximately 45,000 troops from the eight nations of Germany, Japan, Russia, Britain, France, the United States, Italy and Austria-Hungary. Neither the Chinese nor the foreign allies issued a formal declaration of war, and no treaty or formal agreement bound the Alliance together. Western historians revised history to define the first phase of hostilities as starting in August 1900 and 'more or less a civil war', despite the fact that the Battle of the Taku Forts (1900), which took place in June, was what pushed the Qing government to support the Boxers. With the success of the invasion, the later stages developed into a punitive expedition that pillaged Beijing and North China for over a year. The fighting ended with the signing of the Boxer Protocol."

The Axis were united in their opposition to the Allies, but otherwise lacked comparable coordination and ideological cohesion. The Axis grew out of successive diplomatic efforts by Germany, Italy, and Japan to secure their own specific expansionist interests in the mid-1930s. The first step was the protocol signed by Germany and Italy in October 1936, after which Italian leader Benito Mussolini declared that all other European countries would thereafter rotate on the Rome–Berlin axis, thus creating the term 'Axis'. The following November saw the ratification of the Anti-Comintern Pact, an anti-communist treaty between Germany and Japan; Italy joined the Pact in 1937, followed by Hungary and Spain in 1939. The 'Rome–Berlin Axis' became a military alliance in 1939 under the so-called 'Pact of Steel', with the Tripartite Pact of 1940 formally integrating the military aims of Germany, Italy, Japan, and later followed by other nations. The three pacts formed the foundation of the Axis alliance."

La Florida formed part of the Captaincy General of Cuba, the Viceroyalty of New Spain, and the Spanish Empire during Spanish colonization of the Americas. While its boundaries were never clearly or formally defined, the territory was initially much larger than the present-day state of Florida, extending over much of what is now the southeastern United States, including all of present-day Florida plus portions of Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Louisiana. Spain's claim to this vast area was based on several wide-ranging expeditions mounted during the 16th century. A number of missions, settlements, and small forts existed in the 16th and to a lesser extent in the 17th century; they were eventually abandoned due to pressure from the expanding English and French colonial settlements, the collapse of the native populations, and the general difficulty in becoming agriculturally or economically self-sufficient. By the 18th century, Spain's control over La Florida did not extend much beyond a handful of forts near St. Augustine, St. Marks, and Pensacola, all within the boundaries of present-day Florida."

Bayern is the most successful club in German football history, having won a record 30 national titles, including eight consecutively since 2013, and 20 national cups, along with numerous European honours. FC Bayern Munich was founded in 1900 by 11 football players, led by Franz John. Although Bayern won its first national championship in 1932, the club was not selected for the Bundesliga at its inception in 1963. The club had its period of greatest success in the mid-1970s when, under the captaincy of Franz Beckenbauer, it won the European Cup three consecutive times (1974–1976). Overall, Bayern has reached eleven European Cup/UEFA Champions League finals, winning their sixth title in the 2020 final as part of a continental treble, after which it became only the second European club to achieve the continental treble twice. Bayern has also won one UEFA Cup, one European Cup Winners' Cup, two UEFA Super Cups, two FIFA Club World Cups and two Intercontinental Cups, making it one of the most successful European clubs internationally and the only German club to have won both international titles. By winning the 2020 FIFA Club World Cup, Bayern Munich became only the second club to win the sextuple. The club has traditional local rivalries with 1860 Munich and 1.

He recognized three groups—A, B, and O—based on their reactions to each other. A fourth group, AB, was identified a year later by another research team. Red cells of the A group clump with donor blood of the B group; those of the B group clump with blood of the A group; those of the AB group clump with those of the A or the B group because AB cells contain both A and B antigens; and those of the O group do not generally clump with any group, because they do not contain either A or B antigens.

Then when the attendant moved out of the way, he lunged towards the train, jumping up on a step on the side of the carriage as it began moving out of the station. He fired two shots from a pistol into the royal compartment. One narrowly missed the Prince’s head but hit a metal hand rest and landed on the seat; the other flew harmlessly through the air. But before he could fire a third shot the station master, Charles Crocius, wrestled the shooter to the ground. Another shot was fired as others rushed forward to help. Rummaging through his pockets the station master found anarchist literature and papers identifying him as 15-year-old Jean-Baptiste Sipido, a tinsmith’s apprentice."

Lucas, a Croatian immigrant who had vast experience in drilling for salt in Louisiana, was brought to the Spindletop Hill area by Pattillo Higgins in 1899 to create a new drilling company. Higgins, as a member of the Gladys City Oil, Gas and Manufacturing Co., had suffered seven years of dry holes. Oil explorers were certain that Spindletop, with its sulfur springs and natural gas seepages, was an ideal site for crude oil. With their well at 575 feet, the two men ran out of money and, like many others before them, were ready to abandon, when two investors from Pittsburgh — John Galey and James Guffey — stepped in. Lucas was crammed down to a tiny share and Higgins was pushed out of the venture, but Lucas had money to keep drilling deeper."

DNC_Expansion_country.38.d:0 "The state funeral of Queen Victoria took place in February 1901; it had been 64 years since the last burial of a monarch. Victoria left strict instructions regarding the service and associated ceremonies and instituted a number of changes, several of which set a precedent for state funerals that have taken place since. First, she disliked the preponderance of funereal black; henceforward, there would be no black cloaks, drapes or canopy, and Victoria requested a white pall for her coffin. Second, she expressed a desire to be buried as 'a soldier's daughter'. The procession, therefore, became much more a military procession, with the peers, privy counsellors and judiciary no longer taking part en masse. Her pallbearers were equerries rather than dukes (as had previously been customary), and for the first time, a gun carriage was employed to convey the monarch's coffin. Third, Victoria requested that there should be no public lying in state. This meant that the only event in London on this occasion was a gun carriage procession from one railway station to another; Victoria having died at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight, her body was conveyed by boat and train to Waterloo Station, then by gun carriage to Paddington Station and then by train to Windsor for the funeral service itself."
