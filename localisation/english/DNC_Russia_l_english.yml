RUS_NICHOLAS_II:0 "Nicholas II"
RUS_DURNOVO_NAME:0 "Ivan Durnovo"
NICHOLAS_II_LEADER_DESCRIPTION:0 "Nicholas II, the Emperor of All Russia, and of all the Russians. The sixth Tzar of the house of Romanov, Nicholas' bloodline is of pomp, circumstance and illustrious honors. Ruling since 1894 after his father Alexander's death, Nicholas has christened his reign with a stout devotion to his duties and the orthodox church. Crowned a saint, and known as the Passion-Bearer, Nicholas' reverement in the church seems to be the strongest unifying factor for his people. A traditional man, many times has Constitution been suggested, and many times has his absolute rule been enforced. Wishing for nothing more than the continuation of greater Russia, Nicholas is hell bent on keeping things orderly, with little time for fanciful affairs and more time for his family and his duties, Nicholas has done little to step outside the perverbial box of ruling enactment. However, the Tzar is notably plagued with bad omen. During his coronation celebration, over one thousand Moscow Citizens were trampled, with another thousand injured due to fears of lack of food. Even on trips to visit western Europe, Nicholas repeatedly suffered from headaches, toothaches and illnesses, a sign apparently of bad relations, or something more sinister to come. So far, the focus of Nicholas is the economy. The Trans-Siberian railway is one of the largest logistical and industrial projects for Russia to date, and the enactment of the gold-standard in 1897 saw what was the idea of a firm and stable Russian economy. So far uneventful and uninspiring, it looks to be Nicholas' reign will be one without disturbance and one without distribution. If it wasn't only for the consistent bad omens and misfortune plaguing his rule, it would seem everything is going fine..."
DURNOVO_LEADER_DESCRIPTION:0 "Ivan Nikolayevich Durnovo, the 16th Chairman of the Committee of Ministers, officer of the Russian Imperial Army, the second most important person in the Russian bureaucratic ladder, nicknamed ''Head of Veal'' for his leadership qualities. Previously a Marshal of Nobility, the Chernigov Governor, the Yekaterinoslav Governor, Deputy Minister of Interior (later on he became Minister of Interior) and member of the Forth Section of His Imperial Majesty's Own Chancellery. Count Sergei Witte, the Minister of Finance,  describes him as ''a pleasant Marshal of Nobility, a pleasant governor, a pleasant Deputy Minister of the Interior. But he is not a cultured or intelligent person; rather, one rather limited in his abilities. A hospitable, polite, and very cunning man.''. He can easily earn trust of his superiors. Despite that he is not popular amongst the people of Russia. His abilities are a subject of jokes and mockery. Nonetheless he carried out many economic and social reforms such us decreasing the working hours. Durnovo was not known, however, for his innovations, but rather for following his predecessor's policies. Let's hope he'll serve Mother Russia well."
