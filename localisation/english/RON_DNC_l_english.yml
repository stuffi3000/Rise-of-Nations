rondncevent.1.t:0 "The Leader Of [ROOT.GetNeutralParty] Speaks"
rondncevent.1.d:0 "Today, many people were rallied in [Root.Capital.GetName] to listen to a speech of the leader of [ROOT.GetNeutralParty]. He talked a great length about the accomplishments of the current democratic government, but eventually went on on [ROOT.GetName]'s past greatness and that the country is only a shadow of its former self. This seems to have struck a nerve, as many people are not fully pleased with the [ROOT.GetLeader] cabinet."
rondncevent.1.a:0 "He seems to be a fine man."

rondncevent.2.t:0 "An Interesting Offer"
rondncevent.2.d:0 "The leader of [ROOT.GetNeutralParty] was sitting in his chair and preparing for his time in government, because all polls indicated a landslite victory for him and his party. Suddenly, he heard a knock on the door. He opened, but the only thing he found was a letter: "If you wish to bring [ROOT.GetNameDef] to the glory it deserves, take your momentum and do what is right." The letter was written by a high army general, implying nothing less but a coup. How should he react?"
rondncevent.2.a:0 "It's time we restore order in [ROOT.GetName]."
rondncevent.2.b:0 "Is he serious? Of course not."

rondncevent.3.t:0 "The People Protest"
rondncevent.3.d:0 "Shortly after [ROOT.GetLeader] took power, unionists, students and other liberals began protesting in the whole country. We need to restore order quick, or [ROOT.GetLeader] will only be a footnote in history."
rondncevent.3.a:0 "Now who could've seen that coming?"

rondncevent.4.t:0 "The First [ROOT.GetAdjective] Congress"
rondncevent.4.d:0 "Today, on the [GetDateText], people rallied before the new congress building in [Root.Capital.GetName]. There, [ROOT.GetLeader] held a big speech about the future of the nation, and what he plans to accomplish within the next years of his administration. Later that day, the parliament already passed its first bill."
rondncevent.4.a:0 "What a great start!"

rondncevent.5.t:0 "The Day Of The Rope"
rondncevent.5.d:0 "It was a cloudy day in [Root.Capital.GetName], and saying that it fit the sight, many citizens "enjoyed", would be an understatement. In the whole city, union activists, protestors and other people were hanging from lampposts. No one said a word, in fear to be next."
rondncevent.5.a:0 "They had it coming."

rondncevent.6.t:0 "The Coronation Of [ROOT.GetLeader]"
rondncevent.6.d:0 "After the recent weeks and months of struggle, [ROOT.GetLeader] finally stabilised his rule over [ROOT.GetName] and was finally crowned today. Countless people were gathered, be it of fear or actual patriotism, and celebrated their new king."
rondncevent.6.a:0 "Finally, it's over."

rondncevent.7.t:0 "The Fate Of The Nobility"
rondncevent.7.d:0 "Now, that [ROOT.GetName] has been transformed into a democracy, it's up to decide about what should happen to the former aristocrats. Many of our more radical party members not only want them strapped from their titles, but also banned, far away from [ROOT.Capital.GetName]. But while it might prove our commitment to democracy, there also most likely is a less extreme option."
rondncevent.7.a:0 "Remove their titles, but nothing else."
rondncevent.7.b:0 "Remove their titles and open the royal palace for the public."
rondncevent.7.c:0 "Ban them to a far away village."

rondncevent.8.t:0 "The Fate Of The Protestors"
rondncevent.8.d:0 "We have more or less tightened our grip on [ROOT.GetName], but there still remains one question: what to do with the ones who opposed us. If we release them, there always remains the chance of them causing new trouble, but a chance of redemption might exactly be what [ROOT.GetLeader] needs, in order to be seen as more humane by the public."
rondncevent.8.a:0 "Release them, as long as they don't cause any new trouble."
rondncevent.8.b:0 "Lock them away for good."

rondncevent.9.t:0 "It's Finished"
rondncevent.9.d:0 "After six long months of work, we have finally finished the most ambitious project in [ROOT.GetName]'s history. People celebrate in [ROOT.Capital.GetName], as [ROOT.GetLeader] finally opens the new civilian factory."
rondncevent.9.a:0 "Perfect, just what we needed."

rondncevent.10.t:0 "The Tariff Debate"
rondncevent.10.d:0 "It has come up time and time again: the debate about our tariffs. While the more conservative politicians argue, that high tariffs will protect our industry, others claim that low tariffs will boost our trade. Obviously, we can only decide on one."
rondncevent.10.a:0 "Tariffs can be low on some products, but should be high on most."
rondncevent.10.b:0 "Low tariffs will get our economy back on track."

rondncevent.11.t:0 "The First [ROOT.GetAdjective] Tractor"
rondncevent.11.d:0 "Today, [ROOT.GetLeader] was, for once, in the countryside. Not for campaigning, or at least not exclusively, but to reveal to the farmers and the press the newest invention and "future of farming", as he put it. The reactions, however, were less excited. As the metal behemoth, also known as "tractor" started, many farmers were scared, but after some time, they began appreciating it."
rondncevent.11.a:0 "We're off to a good start."

rondncevent.12.t:0 "Experimenting With Fertilizer"
rondncevent.12.d:0 "In a series of modernising farming, the government began subsidising chemical businesses, and it seems to finally pay off. Today, leading researchers presented the "fertilizer", that, as they claim, will improve the growth of plants by a stunning 5-10%."
rondncevent.12.a:0 "It'll only go up from here."

rondncevent.13.t:0 "The Role Of The Artillery"
rondncevent.13.d:0 "With modern warfare constantly advancing, time has come, to decide about the role of one of its newest inventions: artillery. Artillery can have a decisive role, but is also more expensive than a regular rifle. So, what importance should it receive?"
rondncevent.13.a:0 "Artillery should be in a supportive role."
rondncevent.13.b:0 "Artillery should take a more direct role in combat."
