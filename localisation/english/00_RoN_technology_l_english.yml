The result is effectively two or more rockets stacked on top of or attached next to each other. Two-stage rockets are quite common, but rockets with as many as five separate stages have been successfully launched."
RON_Develop_Missiles_desc:0 "In military language, a missile, also known as a guided missile, is a guided airborne ranged weapon capable of self-propelled flight usually by a jet engine or rocket motor. Missiles have four system components: targeting/guidance system, flight system, engine and warhead.

RON_First_Man_On_Mars_desc:0 "A human mission to Mars has been the subject of science fiction, aerospace engineering and scientific proposals since the 20th century. Now its time for us to make it a reality!"
RON_Mars_Colony_desc:0 "Reasons for colonizing Mars include pure curiosity, the potential for the in-depth research humans can provide relative to that delivered by rovers, economic interest in its resources, and the thought that the settlement of other planets could decrease the likelihood of human extinction. Difficulties and hazards include radiation exposure during a trip to Mars and on its surface, toxic soil, low gravity, the isolation that accompanies Mars' distance from Earth, lack of water, and cold temperatures."
