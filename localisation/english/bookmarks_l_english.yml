 PRE_WW1_NAME:0 "Dawn of the New Century"
 PRE_WW1_DESC:0 "A new century dawns across the world. The globe coloured by the last decade of peace and expansion. In Europe its matriarch is nearing her last days. Just how long can the European peace hold?"
 GER_PRE_WW1_DESC:0 "The German Empire was created at Versailles in 1871 with blood and iron after the defeat of France a year previously. But following the rise of Wilhelm II whom sacked Bismarck and his attempts at status quo Germany soon found itself with potential enemies on two fronts. These facts could not have been far from the German military’s mind as 1914 came: as Chief of Staff von Moltke put it - "war is inevitable, and the sooner the better". Time is running out. Can the 'place in the sun' and Germany's dominance in the world still be achieved?"
 AUS_PRE_WW1_DESC:0 "The Dual Monarchy had been created in 1867 from a compromise between Emperor Franz Josef and the nobility of Hungary. A patchwork empire, it was composed of eleven major ethnic groups. the empire centred around the capital, Vienna, and held together to a great degree by the strength of Emperor Franz Josef’s character. To limit Russian influence in the Balkans, Austria-Hungary aligned itself with Germany in 1879, and then with Italy in 1882 to form the Triple Alliance. However, with Germany the dominant party in the alliance, Austria-Hungary would find its foreign policy wishes subordinated to the desires of its senior partner. The rulers of Austria-Hungary."
 TUR_PRE_WW1_DESC:0 "By the 18th century the Ottoman Empire was shrinking with its power eroded by a loss of internal authority and the expansionist ambitions of the European powers. The 19th century and early 20th century saw attempts at reform, including the creation of an executive branch, and a centralised government. But also witnessed the Ottoman Empire's substantial territorial decline. Meanwhile, the Turkish government was largely unable to collect its own taxes and the empire's communications and infrastructure remained primative, causing many to refer to Turkey as the "sick man of Europe". Can the Ottoman Empire modernise and survive or will it pass into the bygone era to where many argue it belongs?"
 RUS_PRE_WW1_DESC:0 "Russia's eyes have fallen on the Balkans and Constantinople, which controls the vital sea route to the outside world. To support this ambition, Russia has the largest army in the world and a rapidly modernising industrial base. However, for all its strength Russia suffers from dangerous weaknesses and severe unrest amongst the populous. Some members of the Tsar's council advise that a "short, victorious war" might rally the people and distract them from their woes. But if the war went badly for Russia, could the Tsar's rule survive the consequences?"

 ENG_PRE_WW1_DESC:0 "At the turn of the century, all appeared well for the British Empire - covering two-fifths of the world's land surface, accounting for a quarter of the world's population, policed by the most professional army in the world and guarded by the mightiest fleet ever built. But beneath the assurances of imperial grandeur lay insecurity about the future: economically and industrially, the United States was outperforming the British and the Germans had commenced an ominous fleet building program to challenge the Royal Navy's dominance of the seas."
 FRA_PRE_WW1_DESC:0 "Once the greatest Power of Europe, France is now a troubled country. Economically, she has been overtaken by many of her rivals. A declining birthrate seems to promise further decline, and in an age of mass armies might prove a fatal weakness. Politically, the Third Republic is unstable. On the international scene, the defeat by Prussia in 1871 and Germany's occupation of the provinces of Alsace and Lorraine is a festering sore, and demands for 'revanche' - revenge - against Germany remain strong."
 USA_PRE_WW1_DESC:0 "Since gaining independence from Great Britain in 1783 the United States and its people have mostly concerned themselves with their own continent, and to a lesser extent Central and South America, following the declaration of the Monroe Doctrine in 1823. Following the defeat of Spain in the Spanish-American War the United States has emerged as a world power, but with its very small army, is still not considered a 'Great Power' in the European sense, although it has vast potential to do so. This potential comes from the population and vast economy that in is greater than Britain, France, Russia and Germany combined."

 ITA_PRE_WW1_DESC:0 "Italy is  the smallest third of the Triple Alliance, an alliance with which she has little faith in. Austria-Hungary, Italy's natural rival, is now a friend in the world of treaties but still a rival in practical terms. After all, Italian Irredentism still decrees the Austrian-held Dalmatian coast as Italian. For now, however, there are more pressing matters. \n\nWar plans with the Ottoman Turks are already being drawn up. The government predicts a short, decisive war. Italy shall prove her power."
 SER_PRE_WW1_DESC:0 "Serbia is seen by outsiders as a backwater, minor nation. Nothing more than a pawn in a great game that the world's empires are playing as each other. Of course, the empires of the world may learn sooner than they think that the Serbs are destined for greater things. \n\nCurrently, most Serbs live outside our borders, in Turkish or Austrian territory. If we are to make a deal with the devil- the Bulgarians- the Serbs may begin their road for glory by way of full Serbian unification."
 BUL_PRE_WW1_DESC:0 "Bulgaria has already made a name for itself through successful conflicts against the Serbs and outmaneuvering the Ottoman Empire to unify with Eastern Rumelia. Of course, now the state stands at a more uncomfortable position. The Turks seem unwilling to put up any more Bulgarian territory for grabs, and the Russians are slowly withdrawing their support. \n\nPerhaps it is not too late to mend fences with Serbia? After all, a Bulgaria with strong friends could be a surprising menace."
 MEX_PRE_WW1_DESC:0 "The Mexico of 1910 is a strange case indeed. The Porfiriato has been a great boon to Mexico since 1876, but now that the heat has been turned up, it seems President Diaz's time may be limited. Of course, the Government sees this as biting the hand. \n\nFrancisco Madero is actively and obviously plotting against the Diaz government. If he finds himself ambitious enough, he may see Mexico in his own back pocket yet."
 JAP_PRE_WW1_DESC:0 "In just under 50 years, Japan has turned from a backwards despotate ruled by a Shogun to a proper modern Empire, just as powerful as any country Europe has to offer. Emperor Meiji is to thank for it, but sadly he is both old and diseased- and can't possibly live much longer. \n\nBefore Crown Prince Yoshihito takes the crown, there are a few more matters to settle, however. The elderly emperor must decide where Japan stands with Russia, and what to do with the Korean vassal."
 BEL_PRE_WW1_DESC:0 "Protected by the British, seen by the German as a backdoor leading to Paris avoiding the fortified French military's concentration along the Franco-German border, the Kingdom of Belgium is in a tricky situation.\n\nKing Albert I will have a difficult choice to make, either stand against the Kaiser Wilhelm II and stood side by side with Entente or either let the German troops walk in its territories and take a different course of action."
 HOL_PRE_WW1_DESC:0 "Since the Second Hague Conference in 1907, the Netherlands do everything to avoid a Political Alliance with another European Empire.\n\nAs the drums of war resound to the gates of Amsterdam and despite their strong policy of neutrality, the peaceful mill country could soon find itself back to the wall having to make a choice that could forever change the future of the Dutch Empire.\n\nNo one knows how the fiercely patriotic Queen Wilhelmina will react..."
 OTHER_PRE_WW1_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, will be affected by this conflict that spans across several continents around the world."
 QIN_PRE_WW1_DESC:0 "China, under the Qing Dynasty, stands at a critical juncture on the eve of the First World War. Once a dominant global power, the dynasty now faces internal strife, foreign influence, and calls for modernization. The aftermath of the Opium Wars and subsequent unequal treaties have left the Qing government weakened and struggling to maintain control over its vast territories. The rise of regional warlords, coupled with the increasing influence of Western powers and Japan, has further fragmented the nation. Amidst these challenges, reformist and revolutionary movements are gaining momentum, seeking to transform China into a modern state capable of reclaiming its former glory. As the world edges closer to conflict, the fate of the Qing Dynasty hangs in the balance, with the potential for significant upheaval and transformation."
 COL_PRE_WW1_DESC:0 "Colombia, nestled in the northwest corner of South America, exudes an aura of tropical tranquility and cultural richness. Its diverse landscapes, from lush rainforests to towering Andean peaks, provide a backdrop for a nation shaped by its biodiversity and history. Before World War I, Colombia is a land marked by its agricultural exports, including coffee and bananas, which contribute to its economy. Its cities blend colonial architecture with modern influences, reflecting a society proud of its heritage yet poised for change."
 SPA_PRE_WW1_DESC:0 "Spain, a cradle of European history and culture, stands at the crossroads of Mediterranean and Atlantic influences. Its sprawling cities, such as Madrid and Barcelona, are centers of art, literature, and innovation. Before World War I, Spain navigates a landscape of political complexities, from constitutional monarchy to burgeoning republicanism. Its rich cultural tapestry, woven from centuries of Moorish, Christian, and Iberian traditions, shapes a nation known for its flamenco music, bullfighting, and culinary delights."

 RUSSO_JAPANESE_NAME:0 "Russo-Japanese War"
 RUSSO_JAPANESE_DESC:0 "The Russo-Japanese War was fought during 1904 and 1905 between the Russian Empire and the Empire of Japan over rival imperial ambitions in Manchuria and Korea. The major theatres of operations were the Liaodong Peninsula and Mukden in Southern Manchuria and the seas around Korea, Japan and the Yellow Sea. Russia sought a warm-water port on the Pacific Ocean for its navy and for maritime trade. Vladivostok was operational only during the summer, whereas Port Arthur, a naval base in Liaodong Province leased to Russia by the Qing dynasty of China, was operational all year. Since the end of the First Sino-Japanese War in 1895, Japan feared Russian encroachment on its plans to create a sphere of influence in Korea and Manchuria. Russia had demonstrated an expansionist policy in the Siberian Far East from the reign of Ivan the Terrible in the 16th century. Seeing Russia as a rival, Japan offered to recognize Russian dominance in Manchuria in exchange for recognition of Korea as being within the Japanese sphere of influence. Russia refused and demanded Korea north of the 39th parallel to be a neutral buffer zone between Russia and Japan. The Japanese government perceived a Russian threat to their plans for expansion into Asia and chose to go to war."

 GRE_BALKAN_POWDER_KEG_DESC:0 "The past few decades have proven quite tough for Greece. The bankruptcy of 1893, the lost Greco-Turkish war of 1897 with imposed international financial control and the Goudi coup of 1909 have left Greece in a dire state. It is time now that reforms are passed in all sectors, especially with the war looming on the sick man of Europe, the Ottomans. \n\nIt is time we rid this country of past failures and stabilize it. Perhaps in the process we will reconquer our long lost capital since 1453."

The nineteenth century brought with it disastrous defeats in the Opium Wars, the rebellion in the south, and numerous failed reforms.

In the end, the country that won all the competition was their unfriendly neighbor Japan, and they deprived Korea of its diplomatic rights, and disbanded the army, without any interference.\n\nNow, the only thing left is to be annexed by Japan. But Koreans are burning with the will to resist to the end."

The True Whig Party rules practically unopposed, an aristocratic dictatorship that resembles more the oligarchic Confederacy of the American Civil War than the bastion of democracy that is the United States. The ruling Afro-American class has deep conflicts with the native population, and struggles to pacify the deeper hinterlands, being forced to collaborate with the British and French imperialists.\n75% of the economy is entirely reliant on the German Empire, and given the current situation in Europe, this doesn't bode well for the future..."

 THE_GREAT_WAR_NAME:0 "The Great War"
 THE_GREAT_WAR_DESC:0 "For the first time in one hundred years in europe a conflict is brewing which will take more lives than any other time in history and last an unusually long time. For the first time in history man and machine will be combined inventing dozens of new methods to kill and destroy, this is the Great War."
 GER_THE_GREAT_WAR_DESC:0 "The German Empire was created at Versailles in 1871 with blood and iron after the defeat of France a year previously. But following the rise of Wilhelm II whom sacked Bismarck and his attempts at status quo Germany soon found itself with potential enemies on two fronts. These facts could not have been far from the German military’s mind as 1914 came: as Chief of Staff von Moltke put it - "war is inevitable, and the sooner the better". Time is running out. Can the 'place in the sun' and Germany's dominance in the world still be achieved?"
 AUH_THE_GREAT_WAR_DESC:0 "The Dual Monarchy had been created in 1867 from a compromise between Emperor Franz Josef and the nobility of Hungary. A patchwork empire, it was composed of eleven major ethnic groups. the empire centred around the capital, Vienna, and held together to a great degree by the strength of Emperor Franz Josef’s character. To limit Russian influence in the Balkans, Austria-Hungary aligned itself with Germany in 1879, and then with Italy in 1882 to form the Triple Alliance. However, with Germany the dominant party in the alliance, Austria-Hungary would find its foreign policy wishes subordinated to the desires of its senior partner. The rulers of Austria-Hungary."
 OTT_THE_GREAT_WAR_DESC:0 "By the 18th century the Ottoman Empire was shrinking with its power eroded by a loss of internal authority and the expansionist ambitions of the European powers. The 19th century and early 20th century saw attempts at reform, including the creation of an executive branch, and a centralised government. But also witnessed the Ottoman Empire's substantial territorial decline. Meanwhile, the Turkish government was largely unable to collect its own taxes and the empire's communications and infrastructure remained primative, causing many to refer to Turkey as the "sick man of Europe". Can the Ottoman Empire modernise and survive or will it pass into the bygone era to where many argue it belongs?"
 RUS_THE_GREAT_WAR_DESC:0 "Russia's eyes have fallen on the Balkans and Constantinople, which controls the vital sea route to the outside world. To support this ambition, Russia has the largest army in the world and a rapidly modernising industrial base. However, for all its strength Russia suffers from dangerous weaknesses and severe unrest amongst the populous. Some members of the Tsar's council advise that a "short, victorious war" might rally the people and distract them from their woes. But if the war went badly for Russia, could the Tsar's rule survive the consequences?"
 ENG_THE_GREAT_WAR_DESC:0 "At the turn of the century, all appeared well for the British Empire - covering two-fifths of the world's land surface, accounting for a quarter of the world's population, policed by the most professional army in the world and guarded by the mightiest fleet ever built. But beneath the assurances of imperial grandeur lay insecurity about the future: economically and industrially, the United States was outperforming the British and the Germans had commenced an ominous fleet building program to challenge the Royal Navy's dominance of the seas."
 FRA_THE_GREAT_WAR_DESC:0 "Once the greatest Power of Europe, France is now a troubled country. Economically, she has been overtaken by many of her rivals. A declining birthrate seems to promise further decline, and in an age of mass armies might prove a fatal weakness. Politically, the Third Republic is unstable. On the international scene, the defeat by Prussia in 1871 and Germany's occupation of the provinces of Alsace and Lorraine is a festering sore, and demands for 'revanche' - revenge - against Germany remain strong."
 USA_THE_GREAT_WAR_DESC:0 "Since gaining independence from Great Britain in 1783 the United States and its people have mostly concerned themselves with their own continent, and to a lesser extent Central and South America, following the declaration of the Monroe Doctrine in 1823. Following the defeat of Spain in the Spanish-American War the United States has emerged as a world power, but with its very small army, is still not considered a 'Great Power' in the European sense, although it has vast potential to do so. This potential comes from the population and vast economy that in is greater than Britain, France, Russia and Germany combined."
 ITA_THE_GREAT_WAR_DESC:0 "22 years ago, Italy halfheartedly joined the Triple Alliance with Germany and the hated Austrians to spite France's gains in Tunisia. Today, the alliance is the most shaky in Europe. With her old alliance, Italy has the chance to get Savoy, Nice, Corsica, and Tunisia for herself. However, the Entente would provide the Dalmatian coast- and seems much more able to do so. \n\nItaly still has time before the war to make a decision. But on which side does her fate lay?"
 SER_THE_GREAT_WAR_DESC:0 "The Balkan Wars saw a massive success for Serbia, as well as their most important ally in Greece. The hard part, however has just begun: The Habsburgs still hold the region of Bosnia, as well as other South Slavic territories. Worse yet, they see Serbia as a troublemaker, and would be more than happy to rid the world of the state at a moment's notice. \n\nFortunately, Russia seems to have taken a liking to Serbia, though perhaps for malicious reasons. If Tsar Peter utilizes this, the world may change forever..."
 BUL_THE_GREAT_WAR_DESC:0 "Bulgaria was wrong to trust the Greeks and the Romanians to stay out of the inevitable conflict between themselves and Serbia, and are down to the lowest territorial extent since independence from the Ottoman Empire. It is unlikely they will be fooled twice. Russia seems next in the line of false friends, seeking only to profit from the state. \n\nThe only countries that seem to genuinely have Bulgaria's best interests at heart are Germany and Austria. Perhaps it's time for a new alliance?"
 MEX_THE_GREAT_WAR_DESC:0 "While initially it seemed Madero's victory in the first phase of the Mexican Civil War was the end of it, in 1913 he was deposed, killed, and replaced by one of his former generals, Victoriano Huerta. Huerta is not popular or terribly competent, and few see him lasting long in command of the nation. \n\nStill, there is no agreement among the Mexican populace as to who is to be the next leader. Some rally behind causes as extreme as Communism or Military Dictatorship. Will Civil War rear its ugly head again?"
 JAP_THE_GREAT_WAR_DESC:0 "Unfortunately, it turns out Emperor Taisho is cursed with mental afflictions which have severely impacted his ability to rule. Fortunately for Japan, his ministers and other members of the Imperial court have begun to administrate Japan, whose public is getting its first taste of liberty. \n\nBut still, what of the war in Europe? Would it be to Japan's benefit to throw in? After all, the British-Japanese alliance is tenuous at best, and Japan may be better off simply waiting to choose which side will serve its interests."
 BEL_THE_GREAT_WAR_DESC:0 "Protected by the British, seen by the German as a backdoor leading to Paris avoiding the fortified French military's concentration along the Franco-German border, the Kingdom of Belgium is in a tricky situation.\n\nKing Albert I will have a difficult choice to make, either stand against the Kaiser Wilhelm II and stood side by side with Entente or either let the German troops walk in its territories and take a different course of action."
 CHI_SCHLIEFFEN_DESC:0 "The 1911 Revolution ended monarchist rule in China, leaving in its place an unstable republic dominated by regional warlords. Yuan Shikai has seized the office of president, but the nation itself is fragile, only held together by the loyalty of his generals.\n\nWith a war soon to break out in Europe, it remains to be seen what will happen to the young republic. Getting involved could expose its severe political instability, but there are many gains to be had from the surrounding empires."
 SWE_SCHLIEFFEN_DESC:0 "At the beginning of the 20th century, Sweden was a country at peace. Indeed, since the Napoleonic Wars and the Treaty of Kiel signed in 1814, the country hasn't experienced any armed conflict and has been able to benefit from a century of peace.\n\nHowever, this fragile peace is threatened by growing tensions between the Great Powers. Will the country remain neutral? Nobody knows..."
 ALB_SCHLIEFFEN_DESC:0 "Albania was marked by a complex web of political and territorial struggles. while being positioned in the crossroads of major European powers.\n\nDespite gaining independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1912, the new state was marred by internal divisions and lacked the stability and institutions necessary for effective governance. This weakness also made Albania an attractive target for neighboring powers seeking to expand their influence in the region."

 SOMME_DESC:0 "The Great War has been going on for almost two years. After the German army launched a surprise attack through Belgium, the Tripple Entente was able to stop the advance. Both factions have dug into trenches and have been waging a fierce battle for a few kilometres of land every day ever since. "
 ENG_SOMME_DESC:0 "Britain does not suffer as much from the great war as France or the Russian Empire. Even if Britain is at war with the Central Powers, only volunteers have to take part in the war. The Royal Navy rules the waves and blocks trade routes to Germany across the North Sea."

 GER_SOMME_DESC:0 "The Tripple Entente was able to stop the Schlieffen Plan just before Paris. The German Empire still has the Inintiative. We must take advantage of this and we must not waste time. The successes on the Eastern Front give our soldiers the confidence they need. God with us !"
 OTT_SOMME_DESC:0 "The Ottoman Empire has a major problems in the Middle East. But not only on the front line. Internal unrest is causing great problems for the sick man of Europe. Many peoples are calling for independence and freedom in the occupied territories. Drastic changes are needed."
 AUH_SOMME_DESC:0 "Germany's most important ally is increasingly in jeopardy. The dual monarchy, with its many different ethnic groups, does not seem to be up to the task of conflict. Comrades shooting at each other don't seem to be uncommon. It's all a matter of language."
 RUS_SOMME_DESC:0 "The Russian Empire is experiencing another disaster. After the embarrassing defeat against Japan in 1905, the poorly equipped Russian army has to hold its own against the German army. Not enough precautions have been made and now there is not even enough ammunition for the armed forces. It doesn't look good for the Russian tsar."

 KAISERSCHLACHT_DESC:0 "For four years now a brutal stalemate has remained on the Western Front but in the east there is no longer a front with the collapse of the Russian Empire and the subsequent signing of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. It has allowed hundreds of thousands of German Soldiers to transfer to the west culminating in a plan for one final great offensive never before seen, the Kaiserschlacht. Austria-Hungary, Turkey, and Bulgaria however are in a very weak state and if a significant victory in the west does not happen it is very likely that not only will Germany collapse but the whole alliance."
 GER_KAISERSCHLACHT_DESC:0 "For four years now a military stalemate has lasted on the Western Front but with the surrender of the Russian Empire, Germany can use those divisions for a momentary numerical superiority over the allied forces on the Western Front. It is critical that we break through the front lines and force an armistice on France whilst the Americans are still in small numbers, once they come here we will stand no chance. The supply situation is getting worse every day and manpower is trickling away like sand through fingers. We have to put all of our effort together to make this one last push or suffer the consequences of capitulation."
 AUH_KAISERSCHLACHT_DESC:0 "The Austro-Hungarian Empire throughout the war has been a disaster but the October 1917 Battle of Caporetto has been a major victory for the Empire and the soon after collapse of the Russian Empire and Treaty of Brest-Litovsk  has relieved our forces in the east to focus on Italy and the Balkans. Though the Empire is still struggling to keep itself together with major war exhaustion and a large anti-war sentiment amongst the people. This will by no means be an task in either winning the war or keeping the empire intact, or both..."
 TUR_KAISERSCHLACHT_DESC:0 "The Allies thought that Turkey would be a pushover, but the war in the Middle East went its own wild way. A struggling empire that is seriously behind in almost every term compared to the west, the Ottoman Empire has managed to hold on four long years of fighting however the tide has turned and the British have taken Jerusalem the holy city, along with Baghdad and is now advancing from both Mesopotamian and Jordan-Israeli fronts towards Damascus and Mosul. If they are to fall so will we, however with the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk signed, our forces in the caucasus are finally free for other use."
 SOV_KAISERSCHLACHT_DESC:0 "Over the course of the Great War the weak Russian Empire grew heavily unstable and many lives were lost to which the soldiers and working class alike lost any trust and patriotism towards the Imperial Government and has formed its own Communist Government led by Vladimir Lenin. The disastrous Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was signed but we had no choice, and now in the midst of all this there is still a larger conflict ahead of us, the Russian Civil War."
 ENG_KAISERSCHLACHT_DESC:0 "The United Kingdom has fought in the fields of Flanders, the plains of Africa, and in the desert of the Middle East. Tremendous amounts of life has been lost over the course of the war and a victory does not seem any closer at times, but with the naval blockade against Germany, our enemy is severely weakened with mass starvation of civilians and military alike as well a heavy decline in morale and war effort. Whilst we are no better with our own war effort as it loses popularity by the day the Americans will soon arrive and provide fresh troops and a industrial superiority over the Central Powers, but we must survive the onslaught of the Ludendorff Offensive first."
 FRA_KAISERSCHLACHT_DESC:0 "The French people desperately outnumbered and outgunned by the Germans have fought on for four years with assistance of the British but the front has barely moved in those four years with a tremendous amount of life that has been lost with it. The Germans however have not managed to break through, not in Verdun, and not on the Belgian Front, however with their troops relieved from Russia they will gain numerical superiority against us, on the flip side the Americans will soon come and relieve us with fresh troops so we must hang on."
 USA_KAISERSCHLACHT_DESC:0 "The United States has largely remained neutral throughout the Great War but with the sinking of the Lusitania, Zimmerman Telegram, and the Black Tom sabotage as well as the loans we have given to the Allied Powers for which we must see repaid, we have been forced to enter the Great War or else face a grave loss of money if the Allied Forces fall. But whilst we have joined the war the year before, the transfer of troops has taken a lot longer than expected and we will only start arriving in Europe in large numbers in the following months."

 GERMAN_PUPPETS_EASTEUROPE_KAISERSCHLACHT_DESC:0 "Our nation, having been part of the Russian Empire for decades—which has now collapsed twice—currently enjoys a form of autonomy under German protection. However, it appears that the German Empire may also be on the verge of collapse, like other nations involved in the Great War."
 BUL_KAISERSCHLACHT_DESC:0 "Bulgaria, having joined the Great War later in 1915, is now on the verge of collapse, with Greece to the south fielding superior forces to ours."
 WHR_KAISERSCHLACHT_DESC:0 "Over the course of the Great War, the already weak Russian Empire became increasingly unstable, with massive loss of life leading both soldiers and the working class to lose all trust and patriotism toward the Imperial Government. In response, they formed a new Communist government led by Vladimir Lenin. The disastrous Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was signed by the Bolshevik regime, but despite this, an even greater conflict looms ahead—the Russian Civil War."
 ITA_KAISERSCHLACHT_DESC:0 "Italy's entry into the war in 1915 has resulted in catastrophic losses and minimal to no progress. The situation in the Alps is even worse than on the Western Front in France, and it appears that if the conflict continues for a few more years, Italy could face economic, social, and demographic collapse."
 UKR_KAISERSCHLACHT_DESC:0 "Ukraine, established as a semi-independent state after 154 years of Russian occupation, has a largely agrarian and outdated economy that struggles to stay current. Giving wheat to Germany for free to prevent starvation among the German population is also not helping the economy, especially given the unstable situation in the former Russian Empire."

 THE_RUSSIAN_CIVIL_WAR_DESC:0 "The conflict known as the Great War has finally come to an end. The Central Powers have been defeated and carved between Entente members- but world peace is still far from reality. Civil Wars rage in the East, particularly in Russia, while instability plagues in the Near East, in China and in the former Central Powers. Even now, peace and prosperity must be fought for."
 GER_THE_RUSSIAN_CIVIL_WAR_DESC:0 "With the collapse of the German Empire, its shadow, the Weimar Republic, has taken its place in Europe. The new government is plagued by a crippled industry, heavy reparations, and most notably, constant conflicts between Communists and the autocratic Freikorps which threaten to tear the country into civil war.\n\n Few are happy with the status quo. If the Republic does not stabilize itself soon, it may meet the same fate as the Germany of 1848."
 RUS_THE_RUSSIAN_CIVIL_WAR_DESC:0 "It is the White Russian forces that protect the public from the scourge of Communism. That scourge has proven itself to be a major problem, however. In the last year of conflict, the Soviets have made decisive gains against the disorganized and disunited White movement. There is hope for White Russia yet.\n\nAs long as it can solve the leadership issues and learn to cooperate with international support."
 SOV_THE_RUSSIAN_CIVIL_WAR_DESC:0 "Lenin's movement is burning through the old Russian Empire like a wildfire. The charismatic, driven leader of Soviet Russia is finding friendly peasants nearly everywhere in the East, despite being reviled by the world at large. Still, there is much left to do.\n\n The new and weak states surrounding Russia- especially Poland- must be brought into the fold to create a true World Revolution!"
 POL_THE_RUSSIAN_CIVIL_WAR_DESC:0 "While the British and French were happy to see a new Polish state on the world stage, few others are pleased with the ''Second Republic''. The defeated Germans desire a return to their old territories, the Czechs and Lithuanians are in a border war, and worst yet- the Soviets are actively attempting to end the state.\n\nWith most of allied Ukraine already lost, Poland is counting on a miracle- but miracles have happened before."
 OTT_THE_RUSSIAN_CIVIL_WAR_DESC:0 "The Ottoman Empire seems doomed. The country has been reduced to a tiny portion of Anatolia, only a small amount of which the government actually controls. It seems that the state, once the world's foremost empire, is on its deathbed. However, did not Osman overcome greater odds to establish the state to begin with?\n\nCan fate be denied? Can the old guard save the nation in its last moment? Or has the moon truly set once and for all?"
 TUR_THE_RUSSIAN_CIVIL_WAR_DESC:0 "With the end of the Empire seemingly inevitable, a massive Nationalist movement has emerged, headed up by Mustafa Kemal Pasha. The Hero of Gallipoli has called for a secular, modernist Republic to be established in Anatolia, but his true ambition seems to be the recovery of occupied Turkish-speaking territory.\n\nFew can deny taking on the Europeans as well as the remnants of the empire would be a great challenge. Can the new Turkey overcome it?"
 ITA_THE_RUSSIAN_CIVIL_WAR_DESC:0 "Italy walked away from the Treaty of Versailles still hungry. Despite suffering a massive death toll compared to the population of the nation, only Istria, Zadar, and limited authority over Albania have been awarded to the Kingdom. Though Entente members have already promised a transfer of South Tyrol, this is still little more territory than the Central Powers promised.\n\nIf the public is not satisfied, Italy may turn its anger against its former allies once again."
 FRA_THE_RUSSIAN_CIVIL_WAR_DESC:0 "In the end, France was just barely able to hold on. The injustice of 1870 has been avenged, German colonies and the Ottoman Levant have bolstered France's empire, and friendly regimes have popped up all over Europe. However, France is still not out of the woods yet.\n\nThe Hapsburg partition is still on the table. Moroccans still protest annexation. Worst of all, the Soviet Union is inspiring the always-present local Communists. If these issues are not dealt with, the victory may be for naught."
 ENG_THE_RUSSIAN_CIVIL_WAR_DESC:0 "Many British sons did not return home from the trenches. Though Tanzania and Namibia have been won, the price paid in blood was steep- especially considering Paris, not London, directs Europe's new governments. In 1919, the British Empire is at its greatest extent- yet it may be the weakest it's ever been.\n\nDiplomacy shall be the new Dreadnought. New agreements and administration shall preserve the empire as our military rebuilds. The first test is dealing with this quabbling in Egypt."
 USA_THE_RUSSIAN_CIVIL_WAR_DESC:0 "The Americans had no appetite for war, and now it's over, it seems more of the public than not is questioning whether it was worth it to intervene. The Federal Government seems to be turning its back on Woodrow Wilson's idealism, towards a cynical neutrality. The Military is already being disarmed, and legislators are fighting every part of the peace process.\n\nIf Congress approves joining the League of Nations, this course may be reversed. If not, the USA may be immersed in unbreakable isolationism."
 JAP_THE_RUSSIAN_CIVIL_WAR_DESC:0 "The Japanese people are, for the first time, living under a democratic government. That idea is not as popular with the public as it may logically seem. The Emperor is clearly not long for this world, and many reactionary figures advocating for a return to autocracy and establishment of colonies have been publicly vocal in the inevitable wake of Prince Hirohito's coronation.\n\nPerhaps they have a point.

 RISE_OF_EVIL_DESC:0 "For nearly a third of the century, the forces of liberalism and democracy have held control of international politics and internal affairs. This worldview is cracking at the seams and a new force is on the march. Italy has been under the rule of a nationalist dictator unlike the world has seen before for the past 12 years. In Germany, the rising tide of a new political ideology opposing freedom and liberalism can be seen. Meanwhile, East Asia suffers under the expansionist policies of the Japanese Empire. In the midst of all this, the economies of America, France and Britain suffer due to the Great Depression. Will democracy be able to turn the ideological tide, or will this mark the beginning of The Rise of Evil?"
 GER_RISE_OF_EVIL_DESC:0 "Hitler attained power in March 1933, after the Reichstag adopted the Enabling Act of 1933 in that month, giving expanded authority. President Paul von Hindenburg had already appointed Hitler as Chancellor on 30 January 1933 after a series of parliamentary elections and associated backroom intrigues."
 ENG_RISE_OF_EVIL_DESC:0 "Although the United Kingdom emerged victorious from the Great War, the foundations of its great empire were shaken to the core.

It is becoming more apparent that there is unlikely to be 'Peace for Our Time'."
 FRA_RISE_OF_EVIL_DESC:0 "Despite the devastation of the Great War, France is on the road to recovery thanks to its strong economy supported by German war reparations. However, the 'Great Depression' has still affected the country and the new German regime has shown little interest in continuing to pay the war reparations stipulated by the Treaty of Versailles.\n\nWith political unrest at home, the words of Marshal Ferdinand Foch when the treaty was signed "This is not a peace. It is an armistice for twenty years" appear to be an omen. Those 20 years are rapidly running out."

 USA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The United States retreated back into isolationism at the end of the Great War and enjoyed a period of economic prosperity during the Roaring Twenties. This came to a dramatic end when the nation was gripped by the 'Great Depression' in 1929.\n\nThe American policy of non-intervention in foreign wars has stood firm, but tension is increasing both in Europe and Asia. The 'Great Neutral' may find itself drawn into the maelstorm whether or not it wants to be."
 OTHER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, both great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the Great War, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance their ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
 POL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:1 "Following centuries in which the nation was divided between three empires, Poland now stands proudly independent once again. However its political position is not an easy one.\n\nTo the east, the Soviet Union has not forgotten its humiliating defeat in the Polish-Soviet war.\n\nTo the west, the German Führer Adolf Hitler makes no secret of his desire for more "living space" for his people and that the former German land now under Polish control will be the first step in him achieveing it."
 CAN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Canada entered the Great War as a British colony and left it as a nation. Born in the sacrifices of the Passchendaele mud, Canada now takes its first few uncertain steps onto the world stage.\n\nHobbled by the 'Great Depression' and with internal divisions between Anglophones and Francophones, the future of this relatively new nation looks anything but secure."
 AST_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Australians earned their place in the history books of the Great War with their blood. The sacrifices made in the Gallipoli campaign have not been forgotten - and neither were those who ordered it.\n\nAustralia now stands at a crossroads should she stay with her colonial master, most likely about to be drawn into more conflict in distant Europe, or should its focus be on the threat that is looming much closer to home?"
 SAF_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "When the Great War began, many in South Africa refused to take up arms for their British masters. The military spent most of the war chasing German forces around their African colonies with limited success.\n\nNow a new war looms on the horizon. Then as now, there are some in that think South Africa shouldn't be fighting against the Germans at all. Some even believe that the time has come for the descendants of the Boers to make their bid for the liberty that was denied to their forefathers."
 NZL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The tiny nation in the South Pacific fought bravely in the Great War, suffering high casualtie rates in the bloody battles at Gallipoli and on the Western Front. Nearly half the men of fighting age had served in the forces fighting overseas and many had not returned.\n\nSome twenty years after end of the Great War, the populace of New Zealand peer anxiously at world events, for this time the threat of war looms ever closer to their own homeland..."
 RAJ_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The 'crown jewel' of the British Empire, the Raj of India is a strange mix of imperial power and powerlessness. A small band of elite British civil servant's rule over a vast sub-continent with a populace of hundreds of millions of subjects. From these ranks they recruit the Indian Army, which fought bravely in the Great War.\n\nIndias leaders hoped that the sacrifices she made in the last war would help her gain independence from Britain, but so far, that hope has been dampened. With a new war looming, many Indians believe that the time has come to take freedom - by whatever means are necessary."
 CZE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "During the Great War, Czech troops fought alongside the Entente forces all over Europe in an effort to secure recognition for their nation. Their efforts were successful, and Czechoslovakia rose from the ashes of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.\n\nSince their explosive entry into statehood Czechoslovakia formed the 'Little Entente' alliance with Yugoslavia and Romania with the aim of suppressing Hungary's efforts to restore the Austro-Hungarian Empire, although as resurgent German power grows the political landscape of Europe is rapidly changing."
 HUN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "One half of the late Austro-Hungarian Empire, Hungary was treated as a defeated enemy by the victorious Entente after the Great War losing two thirds of its territory in the Treaty of Trianon. Millions of ethnic Hungarians found themselves living outside its borders, and its economy was left in ruins. Harsh restrictions on rearmament were supposed to ensure that Hungary could never again threaten the peace in Europe.\n\nAs the political climate in Europe shifts, it may be time to finally right the wrongs of the past and regain the former glory of the nation."
 ROM_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Romania found herself on the winning side in the Great War, and as a result, gained new territories and people - not all of whom were Romanians. To guard against the desires of those countries that were forced to cede land to regain what they felt was rightfully theirs, Romania has created a web of alliances across the Balkans. However, in recent years she has mostly concerned herself with domestic matters and the government of King Carol II has allowed these alliances to lapse.\n\nAs the political situation in Europe changes, Romania may well find herself standing alone - and vulnerable."
 YUG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Yugoslavia came into existence after the merging of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes with the formerly independent Kingdom of Serbia in 1922. Initially Yugoslavia joined both the Little Entente and the Balkan Pact to secure their independence, but recently the assassination of King Alexander, combined with growing pressure internally from nationalists and externally from Italy and Germany has caused drastic upheaval and allowed for a re-evaluation of their political and strategic position."
 MAN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Evicted from the Dragon Throne at the age of six, Puyi, the last Chinese Emperor, has been biding his time. While his former realm tore itself apart in the Chinese Civil War, Puyi found new allies in Japan.\n\nFor Puyi, the establishment of the Empire of Manchukuo in 1932 was but the first step in the quest to reclaim his ancestral birthright. For the moment, he is dependent on the Japanese Army to keep his rule, but in time, an opportunity might arise to cast off the shackles of servitude and become what he was born to be..."
 CHI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Following the revolution that deposed the last of the Qing Emperors, the young Chinese Republic has struggled to survive. Warlords rule much of the land on the periphery. In the heart of the country, the Communists have set up a base area in a remote mountain valley. Just beyond the borders, the Japanese have created a puppet government under the last Chinese Emperor and will try to reunite the country under his rule.\n\nWith many enemies threatening it, the government of Chiang Kai-Shek will have to make hard choices if it wants to survive and rule supreme in China."
 PRC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "A mere two years ago, the Communist Party of China faced utter annihilation. To survive, it engaged on the epic journey that would become known as the Long March. With only a fraction of the army surviving the rigors of the march and little industry, the prospects of victory in the Chinese Civil War are slim indeed.\n\nBut in time, the population may be swayed to the Communist cause, new armies be raised, new base areas established, and, when the time is right, the revolutionary struggle will be renewed again, until final victory is achieved."
 WARLORDS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The weakness of the Central Government may yet provide the opportunity for a sufficiently ambitious man to rise to power. At the periphery of the country, local leaders have carved out their own little fiefdoms, caring little for the orders of the Central Government.\n\nWar is on the horizon, and each of these Warlords faces a difficult choice Collaboration with the Central Government or an alliance with the Communists? Either option promises a chance for a seat at the table, but there is a third possibility - to take China all for themselves."
 TUR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The youthful Republic of Turkey has finally shaken off its historic Ottoman past. Under the leadership of Mustafa Kemal the old ways are being consigned to history and a newer, more modern Turkey is slowly emerging.\n\nDoes Turkeys geographical position mean that it is well placed to capitalise if war once again breaks out in Europe? Will she be able to defend herself, if attacked, by any of the major factions?"
 FIN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Finnish Republic looks nervously to the East. Despite a healthy recovery from the 'Great Depression' diplomatic relations with the Russian bear are starting to become strained. Rumours abound that the blood of Finnish civillians is being spilt in the former Finnish Karelian region.\n\nOur tiny nation is no match for the mighty Soviets should conflict come. Perhaps though, we can still give them a bloody nose and maybe find willing allies to help support our cause?"
 SWE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Sweden is steadily growing its indutrial base to meet demand for its steel, ball bearings and wood products. Can this fruitful Social Democratic nation ride out a potential European conflict?\n\nWould such a conflict perhaps give it an opportunity, along with its Scandanavian neighbours, to align and unite to face its common enemies? "
 HOL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Holland is still feeling the crippling effects of the 'Great Depression'. With growing unrest within its civillian population will the country be forced to ditch the 'gold standard' which many blame for its current woes?\n\nMeanwhile the Dutch government is heavily relying on its stated neutrality to avoid getting embroilled in European conflict, should it come."
 BEL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Belgium may be seen by some as an insignificant territory but its posiition as a densly industrialiseed country extracting preciosu resources from its African colony make it a potential target for those with lofty ambitions....\n\nRecovering from the 'Great Depression' with major infrastructure projects underway it still seems that a greater number of voters seek solutions in extremist discourses. Leon Degrelle is gaining popularity and may come to threaten the traditional coalitions of the democratic parties. Flemish nationalists are also active, spreading trouble amongst Flemish soldiers!"
 IRE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Irish Free State has managed to remain a democracy despite the growth of dictatorships within mainland Europe and the 'Great Depression'.\n\nWith a new world conflict potentially on the horizon should the nation align itself with enemies of the hated United Kingdom or should it attempt to remain neutral and try to secure independence and a united Ireland through diplomatic means?"
 SPR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Born in 1931, the Second Spanish Republic is desestablized. The fall of the centrist government of Alejandro Lerroux due to corruption scandals has led to new elections in february. In the meanwhile, the government of Manuel Portela rules the country.\n\nPowered by leftist republicans and the PCE, the left-wing elements, except the anarchist CNT, have united in the Popular Front. In the meanwhile, the right is divided in monarchists, fascists and the legalist CEDA. In the edge of a civil war, consumed by violence and in need of modernization, how will Spain survive?"
 POR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Portugese Second Republic, led by António de Oliveira Salazar is a mildly fascist coporative state led by a single party regime.\n\nWith its only neighbour seemingly heading for civil war, how will this country react should another war break out on its borders? "
 IRQ_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Born out of three former Ottoman Vilayets, Iraq first came into existence under British administration in 1920 with King Faisal and was granted independence in 1932, but with continued British presence. After Faisal's death in 1933, the country became a pressure cooker, at any moment it would blow up in a civil war. On one side the nationalists and on the other the pro-UK militants.\n\nWill you be able to restore the stability of your country? Or will you bring it to ruin?"
 BUL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Bulgaria found itself on the losing side of the Great War. Whatever was left of the third Bulgarian Empire was destroyed by the Allied Powers and their forced demilitarization of Bulgaria. On top of demands of the Western Powers, Bulgaria's fellow Balkan countries also placed reistrictions upon the country.  \n\nUnlike Austria, Germany and Hungary however, Bulgaria had a clean record of abiding by the peace demands of the Allied Powers."
 ALB_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Albania finds itself in a precarious position in 1936, surrounded by larger and more powerful neighbors. The country is governed by a democratic regime, but its small size and limited resources make it vulnerable to external pressures. With tensions rising in Europe, Albania must navigate carefully to protect its sovereignty and independence."

Despite being a democracy, Austria's political landscape is characterized by instability and internal divisions. The country's decision to stay in or leave the Commonwealth will have significant implications for its future."
 AUS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Since the End of the Great War Austria has been isolated in the world. The Anschluss was forbidden by the 1919 Treaty of Versailles, and Austria suffered major territorial losses. Austria experienced a rise of right wing populism, and eventually the creation of a dictatorship. With the Assassination of Dolfuß in 1934, Kurt Schuschnigg is now in charge of Austria, but his position is still weak with increasing pressure from both Germany and Italy, and the Allies have yet to show their support for Austria and her independence, in its precarious position. Only time will tell, if Austria can survive the coming storm..."

 BLITZKRIEG_NAME:0 "Blitzkrieg"
 BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "In the last few years the world has seen some new wars break out in Europe and Asia. Spain is now governed by nationalists and Japan has fought both the Soviet Union and China for territory, the latter being a more successful battle for Japan. The new non-aggression pact between the Soviet Union and Germany may be bad news for the rest of Europe."
 ENG_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Although the United Kingdom emerged victorious from the Great War, the foundation of its great empire was shaken to its core. A generation of the country's finest were lost in the trenches of Flanders and Northern France, while unrest spread throughout the Commonwealth and massive debts accrued.\n\nWith the trauma of the last war still in fresh memory, the country now faces the prospect of another. It is becoming increasingly clear that there will be no Peace for Our Time."
 FRA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The Great War still fresh in its memory, France faces a new conflict after Germany showed they have no intention to keep the peace. Strengthening border defenses and choosing Allies wisely may very well be the way for France to avoid a disastrous war.\n\n France was victorious once before, this time shall be no different!"
 GER_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "After the remilitarization of the Rhineland, the French and the British grew increasingly suspicious of Germany's intentions. The Munich Agreement gave Germany permission to annex the Sudetenland for the sake of its German people. The Molotov-Ribbentrop pact guarantees non-aggression between Germany and the Soviet Union, but also specifies the partitioning of Poland between the two nations. \n\nGermany has waited too long for this moment. The time to act is now!"
 JAP_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "War is raging in the Southeast. Even though Japan suffered some losses early in '39, a big portion of Chinese territory is under Japanese control. Tension is rising in Europe, and while the Soviet Union is focusing their attention on those matters, they shouldn't interfere in the war in Asia. \n\nWhen China's resources are in Japanese hands, the Soviets will be easy to deal with."
 ITA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Mussolini, the dictator of Italy, achieved some fame as a peace keeper for his part in the Munich agreement a year ago. However, German territorial expansion has made Italy see there is more land to claim if an understanding with the Germans could be reached. \n\nAlbania has been conquered merely as a taste of Italy's military capabilities, and the rest of the world would do well to worry."
 SOV_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Supporting Manuel Azaña and the 'Second Spanish Republic' during the Spanish Civil War has clearly shown where the Soviet Union stands in relation to Italy and Germany. Victorious over the Japanese army in several recent border conflicts, the Soviet Union currently seems a power too major for any single country to oppose. \n\nThe promise made by Germany to partition the Baltic States and Poland is welcome at this time."
 USA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The rising tension in Europe is worrying. Although not yet a real concern for the United States, the aggression shown by Germany could soon be heard all over the world. While things are quite peaceful in the west, military preparations may not be a bad idea, all things considered. \n\nShould the United States get drawn into another war, they will be the ones to end it."
 OTHER_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the Great War, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
 POL_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "After centuries in which the Polish nation has been divided between three empires, Poland now stands independent once again. But its position is not an easy one. \n\nIn the east, the Soviet Union has not forgotten the humiliating defeat in the Polish-Soviet war. \n\nIn the west, German Führer Adolf Hitler makes no secret of his desire for more "living space" - and that the former German areas now under Polish control will be the first step to achieve it."
 CAN_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Canada entered the Great War as a mere colony and left it as a nation. Born in the mud of Passchendaele, Canada now takes its first few uncertain steps onto the world stage. \n\nHobbled by the Great Depression and with internal divisions between Anglophones and Francophones, the future of this new nation looks anything but secure."
 AST_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Australians earned their place in the history books of the Great War in blood. The sacrifices made in the Gallipolli campaign have not been forgotten - and neither were those who ordered it. \n\nAustralia now stands at a crossroads: should she stay with her colonial master, about to be drawn into yet another conflict in distant Europe, or should the focus be on the threats that are appearing closer to home?"
 SAF_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "When the Great War began, many in South Africa refused to take up arms for their British masters. The South African military spent most of the Great War chasing around German forces in their African colonies, with limited success. \n\nNow a new war looms on the horizon. Then as now, there are some in South Africa that think the country shouldn't be fighting against the Germans at all. Some even believe that the time has come for the descendants of the Boers to make their bid for the liberty that was denied to their forefathers."
 NZL_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The tiny nation in the South Pacific fought bravely in the Great War, suffering high casualties in the bloody battles at Gallipoli and on the western front. Nearly half the men of fighting age had served in the fighting overseas, and many had not returned.\n\nSome twenty years after end of the Great War, the people of New Zealand look anxiously at the world stage, for this time, the threat of war seems to draw ever closer to their own home..."
 RAJ_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The crown jewel of the British Empire, the Raj of India is a strange combination of imperial power and imperial powerlessness. A tiny elite of British civil servants rule over a vast subcontinent filled with hundreds of millions of subjects. From their ranks recruits the Indian Army, which fought bravely in the Great War.\n\nIndian leaders hoped that the sacrifices made in the last war would help India gain her independence from Britain, but so far, that hope has been disappointed. With a new war looming, many believe that the time has come to take that freedom - by whatever means necessary."
 HUN_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "One half of the late Austro-Hungarian Empire, Hungary was treated as a defeated enemy by the victorious Entente after the Great War. In the Treaty of Trianon, the country lost almost two thirds of its territory. Millions of ethnic Hungarians found themselves living outside its borders, and its economy was left in ruins. Harsh restrictions on rearmament were supposed to ensure that Hungary could never again threaten the peace in Europe. \n\nBut with the political climate in Europe shifting, the time may have come to finally right the wrongs of the past, and regain the former glory of the nation."
 ROM_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Romania found herself on the winning side of the Great War, and as a result gained new territories and people - not all of whom were Romanians. To guard against the revanchist desires of the countries that were forced to cede land, Romania has created a web of alliances all across the Balkans. In recent years, however, the country has concerned itself mostly with domestic matters, and the government of King Carol II has allowed these alliances to lapse. \n\nAs the political situation in Europe changes, Romania may well find herself standing alone - and vulnerable."
 YUG_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Yugoslavia came into existence after the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes merged with the formerly independent Kingdom of Serbia in 1922. Initially Yugoslavia joined both the Little Entente and the Balkan Pact to secure their independence, but recently growing internal pressure from nationalists and external pressure from Italy and Germany has caused drastic upheaval and reevaluation of their political and strategic position."
 CHI_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "After two years of war against the Japanese, the armies of Chiang Kai-Shek have bled themselves white trying to stop the assault. The enemy has overrun the richest areas of the country. Little support has been forthcoming from the western democracies, and the Communist seem unwilling to engage the enemy in open battle.\n\nWith the war threatening to spread even further, it appears that the worst is still to come. But as the Japanese attack is slowed by the vastness of the country, they may well turn their gaze in other directions, and new alliances may yet turn the tide..."
 PRC_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Faced with an all-out Japanese attack, the Nationalists and Communists have struck an uneasy truce. Both sides are well aware that this United Front can not last. The Communist base area in Yan'an now forms the front line in the war against the Japanese.\n\nThe Communists must husband their resources carefully if they want to survive. Any casualties suffered in the fight against Japan will be felt twice over when the time comes to fight the war against the Nationalists, and this may well be what the government of Chiang Kai-Shek is counting on..."
 MAN_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Evicted from the Dragon Throne at the age of six, Puyi, the last Chinese Emperor, has been biding his time. While his former realm tore itself apart in the Chinese Civil War, Puyi found new allies in Japan.\n\nFor Puyi, the establishment of the Empire of Manchukuo in 1932 was but the first step in the quest to reclaim his ancestral birthright. For the moment, he is dependent on the Japanese Army to keep his rule, but in time, an opportunity might arise to cast off the shackles of servitude and become what he was born to be..."
 WARLORDS_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:1 "The war with Japan has forced the Chinese Warlords to pick a side, but there can be no doubt that this alliance is living on borrowed time. The day will come when it has outlived its usefullness, and on that day the game is once again open for every man ambitious and ruthless enough to make a play for the title of Ruler of China."
 MEXICO_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The government of Lázaro Cárdenas has shown itself to be a bigger force for positive social change than that of his predecessor President Plutarco Calles, who has now been exiled to America. With the economic situation stabilized and the foreign oil firms brought under the custodianship of the state, the Mexican government can begin to look outwards. America faces enemies on many fronts and will likely forgive the nationalization of Standard Oil, but those enemies may be even more lucrative to befriend..."
 NETHERLANDS_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "War between Germany and the other European major powers seems inevitable, and though the Netherlands has put its faith once again in its neutrality, its leaders are contemplating making secret staff plans with their southern neighbours in preperation for possible hostilities.\n\nThe army has been mobilized, and work on the Dutch defensive lines is increasing in pace in an attempt to get the country as ready as possible to defend against any infringement of its sovereignty. Should this fail, there are always the colonies..."

Unrest and instability led to Batista's ousting in January 1959 by the 26th of July Movement, which afterwards established communist rule under the leadership of Fidel Castro. While the US first reacted favorably to the Cuban revolution, Castro's legalization of the Communist party and the hundreds of executions that followed caused a deterioration in the relationship between the two countries. It remains to be seen what the future brings. It sure won't be peace."

But with the recent end of the Cold War, the recent rise of the People's Republic of China, how will this world see itself? How will it shape itself? Will the United States continue its dominance? Will the new Russian Federation find the way into the spotlight? What roles will the former great European empires of Britain, France and Germany play? And what role will the shadow of terrorism have? The world has changed. The world is changing."
 ENG_MILLENIUM_DAWN_DESC:0 "The late 1990s have seen Britain boom back onto the world stage after decades of decline. With Hong Kong handed over to China in 1997, the United Kingdom has seen its last great colonial possession go. The once mightiest nation on earth is trying desperately to find a new path to greatness and glory. Entering a promising new millennia with a budget surplus, the options for how to change the nation are endless. But will that path lie in continued cooperation with the United States?

 GER_MILLENIUM_DAWN_DESC:0 "Almost ten years have passed after the reunification of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic. The now-united Germany is a powerhouse of European industry. The German military, on the other hand, lies in shambles. Not enough ammunition for the Bundeswehr, Luftwaffe and Bundesmarine. Germany still carries the weight of Naziand communist crimes against humanity, which hurts the national pride of the German people, which almost none existed. Einigkeit und Recht und Freiheit! People are asking the question: Was the United German State a mistake."
 ITA_MILLENIUM_DAWN_DESC:0 "Italy has been ever so slightly behind the other Great Powers since the beginning of the 20th Century.

Or will they destroy themselves?"

Vicente Fox, representing the National Action Party (PAN), wins the presidential election, signaling a new era of democracy and political diversity.

It is on course to become one of the most significant powers in Europe. Poland's current political situation is an interesting one as PiS has gotten into power and relations with the EU have gotten heated. A staunchly anti-Russian country, Poland has made a large effort to strengthen its relations with the United States."

 LAT_MILLENIUM_DAWN_DESC:0 "After Latvia had gotten its independence from the Soviet Union, and leaving the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance Latvia's economy had taken a hard hit. But that's not the only problem, there is also a problem with Russian minorities and with outdated education systems. Many people in Latvia have started to radicalise, starting parties like Pēdējā partija (last party). Will the crisis continue? Will Latvia stand up and unite the nations of the Baltic? Or maybe even communists will take power again."
 HUN_MILLENIUM_DAWN_DESC:0 "Hungary got rid of communism in 1989. However, Hungary is still recovering from that dictatorship. Many reforms were made and now Hungary is ruled over by Orban who wants to destroy the opposition. Many people oppose him, but will they organise and stage a coup to turn Hungary into a dictatorship or will democracy survive?"

Currently, under India's protection, Bhutan faces many issues such as Lhotshampa minority, a weak economy, and mass illiteracy. Bhutan is right now rapidly transforming, maybe it will turn into a constitutional monarchy, stay as an absolute one, be taken over by its monks, or maybe even there will be a communist revolution in this country?"

Will Chen Shui-bian, an avid Taiwanese nationalist, win the upcoming election and fulfill his dream of becoming an independent country in Taiwan? Or will his dream end in just a daydream?"
 CUB_MILLENIUM_DAWN_DESC:0 "Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Republic of Cuba entered a “Special Period in the Time of Peace”, as it is officially known. The dissolution of COMECON has led to the Cuban economy shrinking by 80% which, aggravated by the US-enforced embargo, resulted in extreme poverty, starvation and widespread dissent. Yet Castro’s regime endured. Economic reforms allowing limited private initiatives and financial help from the EU and China see Cuba enter the XXI century slowly recovering from the horrors of the 90s. What does the future hold?"
 ARM_MILLENIUM_DAWN_DESC:0 "Armenia has re-emerged onto the world stage only reluctantly; it had left the Soviet Union over the issue of Nagorno-Karabakh, where the indigenous population defied both Gorbachev’s and the Azeri attempt to ethnically cleanse the region. But it was shortly after independence that Russia had to step back in to avert a Turkish invasion. Today Armenians stands on the precipice of annihilation, they cannot endure for long wedged between the Turanist project. Will this century be more forgiving than the last, or will the echo of destruction once more reverberate over the Armenian highlands?"
 OTHER_MILLENIUM_DAWN_DESC:0 "World War One, World War Two, Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan. The wars of the past have left the nations of the present fearing for the future. However, there is great hope that humanity might have passed 20 centuries of bloodshed to complete its transition to a period of peace and stability."
 SIG_MILLENIUM_DAWN_DESC:0 "Singapore is a small, tiny island nation located at the mouth of the Malacca straits. After receiving its independence from Malaysia in 1965, the country with no natural resources managed to turn itself from an undeveloped to one of the most developed nations in the world. The nation has become a financial hub in Southeast Asia and has managed to be one of the wealthiest nations in the world. In the 21st century, the small island nation will be facing new challenges and threats. Singapore must stay united as one to face these dark times to come."
 MON_MILLENIUM_DAWN_DESC:0 "CE 2000, Many Mongolians are going through painful times. In 1998, Zorig, Mongolia's national hero, was assassinated, and in 1999, the Mongolian economic crisis broke out.

Or will Mongolia find its own new way?"
 BOS_MILLENIUM_DAWN_DESC:0 "5 years ago, Bosnia was faced with the bloodiest war in Europe since World War 2 and many genocides that tore the country apart. After 3 years of fighting, the young republic emerged partially victorious negotiating with the Croatian Separatists and forcing the Yugoslav-supported Bosnian Serb Separatists to a peace treaty. The Dayton Agreement achieved piece and split Bosnia into 2 autonomous entities, the Bosniak-Croat Federation and Republika Srpska. Now the old leadership of Republika Srpska is being tried for war crimes, while the Bosnian state rises from the ashes. Will it continue doing so?"
 BEL_MILLENIUM_DAWN_DESC:0 "Belgium has reached the 21st century with a new government, going back to the ideals of Liberalism after the old Dehaene II government has gotten into controversies. The Belgian monarchy under King Albert II, is enjoying good public opinion as many are seeing him as the only thing holding the Walloon and Flemish people together. Will Belgium be led into a bright future or will the controversies start to rise once again and radicalism can gain ground in Europe once again?"
 LUX_MILLENIUM_DAWN_DESC:0 "Luxembourg was a neutral and unarmed nation until the end of World War II following two German invasions in between 25 years. The grand duchy knew it would need a military force to counter the next possible aggression so Luxembourg became a founding member of NATO and the European Union. Prime Minister Jean Claude-Junkerand Grand Duke Jean enjoy good public opinion since they are seen as strong and upholding the democratic constitution and Europe. Will Luxembourg stay the richest nation in Europe or will it turn severely to another side?"
 HOL_MILLENIUM_DAWN_DESC:0 "The Netherlands under Prime Minister Wim Kok's second cabinet, has increased in GDP and all improved in many instances. The queen of the Netherlands, Queen Beatrix, is tasked with holding the nation together and being the unpolitical figurehead she is supposed to be. The Dutch lost their biggest colony, Indonesia, in 1949 which raised voices of independence in other parts of the Netherlands such as the ABC islands Aruba, Bonaire and Curaçao. Will the kingdom stay the democratic figurehead of Europe and go forward with Europe or will they go another path?"
 AUS_MILLENIUM_DAWN_DESC:0 "Having been liberated from Nazi occupation in 1945 and being occupied by the four major allied powers for ten years, Austria has gained their independence under the compromise, that the republic of Austria stays neutral between the west and the east. After the fall of the Soviet Union, Austria joined the European Union breaking parts of their neutrality. Although not a part of NATO, Austria joined the Partnership for Peace Program deploying troops to Kosovo and Bosnia. Is the next millenium going be more promising than the last one or will Austria or Austrian neutrality be erased as a whole?"
 LIC_MILLENIUM_DAWN_DESC:0 "Being the fourth smallest nation in Europe, Liechtenstein has sustained centuries without being occupied. It has developed into a big economic zone after the end of World War II even joining the European Economic Area, which their also neutral neighbor Switzerland has not yet commenced. Their prince Hans Adam II, ascended to the throne in 1989 and has been there since. The independence of Liechtenstein is protected by its neighbor Switzerland. Liechtenstein is keeping the same kind of neutrality that Switzerland believes in. Will the little principality survive another millennium without being occupied by another nation or will this mean the unfortunate end of Liechtenstein how it is."
 CZE_MILLENIUM_DAWN_DESC:0 "After 41 years of communist rule, Czechia has returned to democracy. In 1992 Czechoslovakia dissolved into the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic. Czech president Václav Havel has led the Czechs through all these crises and will potentially need to do this again. In 1993 the nation joined the Visegrad group increasing their opinion of countries like Poland, Hungary and Slovakia and a year ago the Czech Republic joined NATO. Will Czechia keep the status quo of a liberal democracy and potentially join the European Union or will they turn to a darker future?"
 POR_MILLENIUM_DAWN_DESC:0 "Having ended the long dictatorship of Estado Novo in 1974 through the Carnation Revolution, Portugal has developed to be one of the safest countries in the world, while also having a democratic government. Portugal was a founding member of NATO and joined with Spain the European Union in 1986. A lot of the nation's income is from tourism alone and Prime Minister António Guterres wants to promote it even more. Portugal is struggling with drug problems even considering legalising all drugs to get some weight off the police's shoulders. Portugal is standing strong in the west and against dictatorships, but will it stay that way?"
 AND_MILLENIUM_DAWN_DESC:0 "The little mountain principality of Andorra has sustained thousands of years since the year 1278, having gained their full independence in 1993 after their new constitution. Andorra is mostly known to the world for their ski slopes which leads to many people arriving in Andorra for tourism. The country is led by two co-princes, one being the president of France while the other is the bishop of Urgell. Andorra is not a member of NATO or the European Union and perhaps does not want to be. How will the future of Andorra be decided?"
 MOC_MILLENIUM_DAWN_DESC:0 "The principality of Monaco has arrived in the 21. century. A gambling paradise with palms and beaches, perfect for a tourism industry. The country is currently ruled by King Rainier III. who founded the circus festival of Monte Carlo to improve tourism even further, but Rainier has slowly deteriorating health. To sum it up Monaco is a hotspot for festivals like circuses, casinos and Formula 1. Will Monaco go forward and keep the status quo, will they eventually lead to joining the European Union and/or NATO, or will they turn even further?"
 SAN_MILLENIUM_DAWN_DESC:0 "The oldest country in Europe dating back to 301 and having the oldest still active constitution in the world. San Marino is a mountain paradise having a wonderful landscape and the Guaita Tower. San Marino has been influenced by fascist Italy in the past and is now still influenced a lot by the Italian government. Captain Regent Gianfranco Terenzi is leading San Marino forth with the intent of a neutral democracy since the government has distanced themselves from NATO and the European Union. Will this change in the future and possibly lead to San Marino choosing a side, or will ideas from the past rise once again to shake up Europe?"
 VAT_MILLENIUM_DAWN_DESC:0 "The seat of the pope, and therefore the most important place for catholicism. The home of the Vatican Apostolic Library which has one of the most precious pieces of text in the world.

 GRE_MILLENIUM_DAWN_DESC:0 "Having just restored democracy in 1975, Greece has stood in the Mediterranean Sea as a NATO stronghold. But the republic is struggling, major debt has been gained over time which Greece is not able to repay without foreign help. In 1981 Greece joined the European Union to get help against the recession and to improve relations with Europe as a whole. Greece has a tough neighbor, Turkey. Greece and Turkey are in constant struggle around specific topics, like the Cyprus question and the status of some of the Aegean islands. Will Greece recover from its recession and stand stronger than ever in the Balkan, or will everything turn to dust?"
 SLV_MILLENIUM_DAWN_DESC:0 "Having gained independence through a bloody revolution in 1991 against Yugoslavia, Slovenia has strengthened its government enough to keep its independence. Slovenia has not aligned with any side but is making moves to potentially join the European Union and/or NATO. President Janez Drnovšek, who is struggling with kidney cancer, was recently elected president and promised to strengthen Slovenia's economy. The people of Slovenia did not forget the ten-day war against Yugoslavia and hoped that Slovenia would not return to being a Serbian puppet. Will Slovenia keep their independence or is it all gonna return to 1991?"
 CRO_MILLENIUM_DAWN_DESC:0 "Croatia gained their independence from Yugoslavia through a war, which in the case of their neighbor Slovenia, didn't last ten days, but four years. After the war and rebuilding of the cities, Croatia's tourism industry started booming again. President Stjepan Mesić has promised to move the country more in the euro-Atlantic zone too potentially join the European Union and/or NATO. Croatia is still not realizing its dark past of having been a nazi collaborator, which many countries critisise. Will Croatia be a democratic tourism hotspot or will it all die down because of the past?"
 SER_MILLENIUM_DAWN_DESC:0 "It has almost been ten years since the dream of a united Slavic nation has collapsed. Having recently been bombarded by NATO for committing crimes against humanity in the state of Kosovo, which is also striving for independence, the Serbian people are staunchly anti-NATO and committed to supporting Russia, but is that what the government intends for? Yugoslavia is in a tense situation having unfriendly relations with its neighbors Bosnia, Albania and Croatia. Will Yugoslavia stay together or will the dream die down once and for all?"
 WAS_MILLENIUM_DAWN_DESC:0 "Since the Maoist warlord forces of Wa State declared independence in 1989, Wa has been able to maintain de facto independence for 11 years while remaining as a de jure territory of Myanmar. But Wa's status is still unstable, because their independence cannot be maintained without Chinese support. Will Wa survive in the 21st century? Will Wa be able to uphold Maoist ideals?"

The once mightiest nation on earth is trying desperately to find a new path to greatness and glory. But will that path lie in continued cooperation with the United States? Should Britain draw closer to its European brethren? Or shall Britannia, on her own, rule the waves once more?"
 ETH_ECONOMIC_CRISIS_DESC:0 "Ethiopia's monarchy was overthrown in 1974 and its subsequent communist dictatorship in 1991. The constitution of 1995 has provided a somewhat stable democracy, but it has failed to address the problems of starvation, political crisis and corruption. It has also not resolved Ethiopia's ongoing conflict with Eritrea."
 FIN_ECONOMIC_CRISIS_DESC:0 "Ever concerned with preserving its neutrality, Finland has carefully watched the Soviet Union's collapse and the subsequent political expansion of the western European forces. The Finns joined the EU in 1995 and is about to adopt the Euro as the national currency. Can peace last? Are the Russians truly pacified?"
 FRA_ECONOMIC_CRISIS_DESC:0 "France, the Grande Nation of old, has tried to find a new spot in an ever-changing world.

Germany, though troubled by its dark past, looks at a bright future."
 ICE_ECONOMIC_CRISIS_DESC:0 "In a hidden corner of Europe, Iceland has successfully kept a low profile since independence in 1944. Political conflicts with the British about fishing rights were perhaps the most exciting time in Icelandic history. Should Iceland take a more central stance?"
 ITA_ECONOMIC_CRISIS_DESC:0 "Italy has been ever so slightly behind the other Great Powers since the beginning of the 20th Century. After the defeat in World War Two, Italy's strong bond to its former enemies and its former ally in Germany has brought them back up to the state of a highly developed and prosperous country. But what will the future hold? National greatness or economic disaster?"

If it reforms too quickly, it might destroy itself."
 RAJ_ECONOMIC_CRISIS_DESC:0 "Where China is the super power of tomorrow, India is the super power of next week.

Through economic and social hardship, the country managed to partially work through the issues that decades of falangism had caused. Spain joined NATO (1982) and the EU (1986) and has tirelessly and under the greatest of efforts worked to catch up to the more powerful and wealthy major countries of Europe; to Germany, France, Britain and Italy.\nIn times like these, Spain requires strong leadership and a stable hand. Can Prime Minister Aznar deliver? Or will his Partido Popular make place for a more worthy leadership?"

Or is it perhaps the time to revive border conflicts of old and let the soldiers march again?"
 SOJ_MODERN_DAY_DESC:0 "Japan is faced with the possibility of war each passing day, as Chinese naval vessels aggressively close into the Senkaku Islands and as North Korean missiles are launched into the stratosphere. Article 9 of the Japanese constitution has recently been amended to allow for a more active Japanese military abroad. This militaristic stance is unpopular with the people, but perhaps necessary to maintain the national security."
 OTHER_MODERN_DAY_DESC:0 "Crimea, the Islamic State, North Korean nuclear weapons. With conflict ever growing, the minor nations of the world need to find a way to either preserve peace or to destroy their enemies as quickly as possible."
 BHU_MODERN_DAY_DESC:0 "Bhutan is a country that is surrounded by India and China, limiting its growth and making them vulnerable to attack and their influence. Currently under India's protection Bhutan faces many issues such as Lhotshampa minority, weak economy, mass illiteracy. Bhutan is right now rapidly transforming, maybe it will turn into a constitutional monarchy, stay as an absolute one, be taken over by its monks, or maybe even there will be a communist revolution in this country?"
 SPR_MODERN_DAY_DESC:0 "Like other Southern European countries, Spain fell into an economic crisis in 2008, requiring economic stimuli from Northern European economies. Podemos and Ciudadanos have brought a new populism and new uncertainty to the old political system, while Catalonian independence movements are more threatening to Spanish unity than ever.\n\nEconomic Recovery will be a long and rocky path - will Spain stay with Europe and stick to the agreements that prevent immediate disaster - or is the future of Spain a different one from the future of Northern Europe?"

 INFORMATION_AGE_DESC:0 "With China claiming territorial waters around its coastlines, with Russia marching into Crimea, with the terrorist Islamic State proclaiming its caliphate, will the world stay the same? The United Kingdom is experiencing unwillingness to continue European integration. Recent terrorist attacks have the entirety of the French national principles shaken. Refugees are seeking shelter from wars and unrest in Syria and Libya. The next presidential election in the USA might be the most decisive one since 1940. The world is still changing."
 ENG_INFORMATION_AGE_DESC:0 "The European Union is more unpopular than ever before. The British people are quick to blame everything wrong with their country on the officials in Brussels, as well as on the German government in Berlin. The population is deeply split around this one particular issue. Britain has recovered from the economic crisis of 2008 well, but leaving the European Union might destroy the economic progress of the past decade. And even then... is national sovereignity not preferable to minor economic gains?"
 FRA_INFORMATION_AGE_DESC:0 "France has suffered from economic hardship and from major terrorist attacks in Paris. The French people grow increasingly antagonistic to their muslim and jewish minorities. The Front National is looking at a possibility to perhaps take power in these troubled times. Will the democratic establishment and French European integration prevail? Or will France stand on her own like in the good old days?"

 ITA_INFORMATION_AGE_DESC:0 "No country of the G7 and the great four of Europe has been so strongly affected by the economic crisis of 2008 like Italy has. Recovery is slow and government support dwindling. The influx of African migrants is not helping at giving the people the image of internal stability. Italy needs to consider her choices. Surely this is not the time to revive imperialism, but drastic reforms will be necessary..."
 PRC_INFORMATION_AGE_DESC:0 "China is very focussed on not letting her enemies not her weaknesses. Pollution, internal migration problems, a dwindling standard in the military, the ever corrupt governing body of the Communist Party. And yet, China is the giant of the east, the one that all the small countries fear. Japan, South Korea, the rebels in Taiwan, Vietnam... all of them united in their hatred for China. It is time for China to find a meaningful answer."

 RUS_INFORMATION_AGE_DESC:0 "Kicked out of the G8, faced with massive economic sanctions, struggling with maintaining its sphere of influence, but at least reunited with its brethren on Crimea. That about sums up the situation of the Russian Federation since March of 2014. With the west now greatly antagonistic to Russia, it must consider either apologizing and retreating into its internationally acknowledged territory or it must find new allies. Beijing comes to mind."

The United States is not living in a national golden age for sure. People are wary of Chinese aggression, of industrial problems and economic hardship, public support for American military alliances is fading.

At a news briefing , WHO Director-General, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, noted that over the past 2 weeks, the number of cases outside China increased 13-fold and the number of countries with cases increased threefold. Further increases are expected. He said that the WHO is 'deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and severity and by the alarming levels of inaction,' and he called on countries to take action now to contain the virus. 'We should double down,' he said. 'We should be more aggressive.'"
