There he pursued a growing passion for two interests, architecture and music, attending ten performances of Lohengrin, where he also firstly met Karl Lueger - a strong populist and nationalist.\nHe later moved to Germany in 1913 and was decorated for his service in German Imperial Army in the World War. His bitterness over the collapse of the war effort began to shape his ideology and after the war he joined the DAP - later renamed to 'Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei', the NSDAP.\nFrom passionate speeches to a few people in the pubs he gradually climbed to a post of Party Chairman. His early followers included Rudolf Hess, former air force ace Hermann Göring, and army captain Ernst Röhm.\nIn 1923 Hitler enlisted the help of World War I General Erich Ludendorff for an attempted coup known as the "Beer Hall Putsch" which failed and Hitler was sentenced to five years of imprisonment at Landsberg Prison. There he dictated most of the first volume of Mein Kampf to his chauffeur, Emil Maurice, and then to his deputy, Rudolf Hess. Although as economic in Germany stabilized, his political influence was severely limited.\nThat all changed on 24 October 1929 with a stock market crash in the US which had a dire impact on Germany. Hitler and the NSDAP prepared to take advantage of the emergency to gain support for their party. They promised to repudiate the Versailles Treaty, strengthen the economy, and provide jobs. And they did.\nHitler was apointed as Chancellor of Germany on 30 January 1933 - fully consolidating his power few months later."

Germany was allowed to own only certain number of ships. Luckily, the agreed terms were overlooked and now the Kriegsmarine already owns number of modern ships. But not enough. Under the Anglo-German Naval Agreement we are allowed to increase our naval production and that's exactly what we are going to do. There are two major plans presented to the Führer.\n\nErich Reader's idea of the once again great High Seas Fleet is based on an ambitious Plan Z. In the successful end the Kriegsmarine should posess 10 Battleships, 4 Aircraft Carriers, 4 Battlecruisers, 20 Heavy and 20 Light Cruisers and more than 100 Destroyers.\n\nAs a contrast to it, Karl Dönitz presented a vision of a huge raiding fleet, that consisted out of modern submarines. Force of that size could significantly hinder allied morale and shipping of war materials to other countries in the future.

The Austrian people desires the unity with the Reich and so we united. The German Reich is no longer willing to tolerate the suppression of ten million Germans across its borders.\n\nWith a direct command from above, the Wehrmacht crossed the border into Austria.

Even though Czech ambassadors were invited to Munich, they weren't allowed to join the conference and remained behind closed door. In there, [GER.GetLeader] testified about how the Sudeten Germans are being oppressed and killed and how the only solution is complete dissolution of Czechoslovakia and transfer of its former territory to Germany, Poland and Hungary.\n\nWhile this solution was unbearable to accept, [GER.GetLeader] then lowered his demands and made clear that he would be content with the annex of the territory where the Germans were the dominant. He went on to say that upon annexing the Sudetenland, Germany would hold no further territorial claims upon Czechoslovakia and would enter into a collective agreement to guarantee the borders of Germany and Czechoslovakia. He also said to [ENG.GetLeader] that this was one concession that he was willing to make to the Prime Minister as a 'gift', for his willingness to cooperate and support its proposal.\n\nEven before we could decide, [GER.GetLeader] issued the Godesberg Memorandum, which demanded that Czechoslovakia cede the Sudetenland to Germany. And if that wouldn't be the case, Germany will take the Sudetenland by force.\n\nThere is no doubt that the war is coming if the Führer is not satisfied. Maybe this small piece of territory can be surrendered to avert the war... Because as [GER.GetLeader] said - 'Sudetenland will be the last territorial demand he have to make in Europe'..."

 umc_ger.440.d:0 "Leningrad's capture was one of three strategic goals in the Operation Barbarossa and the main target of Army Group North. The strategy was motivated by Leningrad's political status as the former capital of Russia and the symbolic capital of the Russian Revolution, its military importance as a main base of the Soviet Baltic Fleet, and its industrial strength, housing numerous arms factories. By 1939, the city was responsible for 11% of all Soviet industrial output.\n\nAs soon as the war with Soviet Union has started, our Wehrmacht forces swiftly moved through Belarus and the Baltic states as planned, as they eventually arrived to the border of the Leningrad city. The siege of the city began as soon as the Wehrmacht severed the last road to the city. The armed forces of Finland also participated in the siege, blocking the approach to the city from the northwest. Although Soviet forces managed to open a narrow land corridor to the city, no proper relieve force ever came, and the city remained essentially surrounded until it's capitulation at[GetDateText] after the final coordinated attack from the Wehrmacht and Luftwaffe had come.\n\nThe city now lies in our hands, and its fate is yet to be decided.\n\nThe siege of Leningrad is cited as one of the biggest city siege in a history of warfare.

With the initial operations being very successful, it was decided that the next campaign would be directed at the southern parts of the Soviet Union. The objectives in the region around Stalingrad were the destruction of the industrial capacity of the city and the deployment of forces to block the Volga River. The river was a key route from the Caucasus and the Caspian Sea to central Russia. Its capture would disrupt commercial river traffic as well as making the delivery of Lend Lease supplies via the Persian Corridor much more difficult.\n\nThe offensive to capture Stalingrad began on the direct order of [GER.GetLeader], using the 6th Army and elements of the 4th Panzer Army. The attack was supported by intense Luftwaffe bombing that reduced much of the city to rubble. The fighting soon degenerated into house-to-house fighting; both sides poured reinforcements into the city. After long weeks of fighting, we managed to push the Soviet defenders back into narrow zones along the west bank of the Volga River, leading to a great loss of lives on both sides.\n\nEven though there were numerous attempts from the Soviet Union to push us back or to attack our weaker flanks around the city, non were successful. After the crossing of the Volga by our forces and igniting the fight on the other side of the city, the Soviet Army began - despite their orders - an uncoordinated retreat.\n\nMarked by fierce close-quarters combat and constant air raids, the battle of Stalingrad was the largest and bloodiest battle in the history of warfare. And from now on, it will be remembered as a bright example of German military skill, courage and dedication."

The bolsheviks still stands in Asia. So even though, in the secret Posen speeches, Heinrich Himmler spoke of the Ural Mountains as the eastern border of the Großdeutsches Reich, where the Germanic race would gradually expand to that eastern border, so that, in several generations' time, the German Herrenvolk, as the leading people of Europe, would be ready to 'resume the battles of destiny against Asia', which were "sure to break out again"; there are already strong voices suggesting that we should continue the fight immediately, and deal with this threat now and forever.\n\nThis is supported by the [GER.GetLeader] 's conviction, in which he is rejecting the mountains as an adequate border, calling it absurd that 'these middle-sized mountains' represented the boundary between the 'European and Asiatic worlds'. He further explained that only a 'living racial wall' of Aryan fighters would do as a frontier, and to keep a permanent state of war present in the east in order to 'preserve the vitality of the race'.\n\nThe decision is hard... and the amount of hard decisions that the Deutsche Volks can bear is shrinking with every other month in war."

All the informations we could gather tells us that this separate deal was negotiated between the London government, not the ambassador present, and enforced by a terrifying showcase of the new deadly German technology advancements.\n\nThe deal states that all of the British Empire will join the German sphere of influence and the government in London will be subjected to a 'non-intervening control' from Germania. In other words - half of the Brits dropped their weapons and surrendered while the other half is ready to turn those weapons against us.\n\nNevertheless, we were also presented with already prepared agreement to sign.

germany_1933.1.t:0 "Hitler Becomes Chancellor"
germany_1933.1.d:0 "On 30 January 1933, the new cabinet was sworn in during a brief ceremony in Hindenburg's office. The NSDAP gained three posts; Hitler was named chancellor, Wilhelm Frick Minister of the Interior, and Hermann Göring, Minister Without Portfolio (and Minister of the Interior for Prussia). The SA and SS led torchlit parades throughout Berlin. It is this event that would become termed Hitler's Machtergreifung ('seizure of power'). The term was originally used by some Nazis to suggest a revolutionary process, though Hitler, and others, used the word Machtübernahme ('takeover of power'), reflecting that the transfer of power took place within the existing constitutional framework and suggesting that the process was legal."
germany_1933.1.a:0 "Interesting..."

germany_1933.2.t:0 "Reichstag Fire Decree"
germany_1933.2.d:0 "The Reichstag Fire Decree was issued by German President Paul von Hindenburg on the advice of Chancellor [GER.GetLeader]  on 28 February 1933 in immediate response to the Reichstag fire. The decree nullified many of the key civil liberties of German citizens. With Nazis in powerful positions in the German government, the decree was used as the legal basis for the imprisonment of anyone considered to be opponents of the Nazis, and to suppress publications not considered 'friendly' to the Nazi cause."
germany_1933.2.a:0 "OK."

germany_1933.3.t:0 "Enabling Act"
germany_1933.3.d:0 "The Enabling Act was a law that gave the German Cabinet, in effect, the Chancellor the power to enact laws without the involvement of the Reichstag, and to override fundamental aspects of the Weimar Constitution. The Enabling Act gave Hitler plenary powers and followed on the heels of the Reichstag Fire Decree, which had abolished most civil liberties and transferred state powers to the Reich government. The combined effect of the two laws was to transform Hitler's government into a legal dictatorship."
germany_1933.3.a:0 "Excellent."

germany_1933.4.t:0 "Ban Political Parties"
germany_1933.4.d:0 "The time has come to ban all political parties except the NSDAP."

These events were held at the Nazi party rally grounds in Nuremberg from 1933 to 1938 and are usually referred to in English as the 'Nuremberg Rallies'. Many films were made to commemorate them, including Leni Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will and The Victory of Faith."
germany_1933.5.a:0 "Sieg Heil!"

germany_1933.6.t:0 "Book Burning"
germany_1933.6.d:0 "The Nazi book burnings were a campaign conducted by the German Student Union (the 'DSt') to ceremonially burn books in Nazi Germany and Austria in the 1930s. The books targeted for burning were those viewed as being subversive or as representing ideologies opposed to Nazism. These included books written by Jewish, pacifist, religious, liberal, anarchist, socialist, communist, and sexologist authors among others. The first books burned were those of Karl Marx and Karl Kautsky."

It was ratified 10 September 1933 and it has been in force from that date onward. The treaty guarantees the rights of the Roman Catholic Church in Germany. When bishops take office Article 16 states they are required to take an oath of loyalty to the Governor or President of the German Reich established according to the constitution. The treaty also requires all clergy to abstain from working in and for political parties. Nazi breaches of the agreement began almost as soon as it had been signed and intensified afterwards leading to protest from the Church including in the 1937 Mit brennender Sorge encyclical of Pope Pius XI. The Nazis planned to eliminate the Church's influence by restricting its organizations to purely religious activities."

germany_1933.13.d:0 "German rearmament (Aufrüstung) was a policy and practice of rearmament carried out in Germany during the interwar period (1918–1939), in violation of the Treaty of Versailles. It began on a small, secret, and informal basis shortly after the treaty was signed, but it was openly and massively expanded after the Nazi Party came to power in 1933. Despite its scale, German re-armament remained a largely covert operation, carried out using front organizations such as glider clubs for training pilots and sporting clubs, and Nazi SA militia groups for teaching infantry combat techniques. Front companies like MEFO were set up to finance the rearmament by placing massive orders with Krupp, Siemens, Gutehofnungshütte, and Rheinmetall for weapons forbidden by the Treaty of Versailles. By 1935, Hitler was open about rejecting the military restrictions set forth by the Treaty of Versailles. Rearmament was announced on 16 March, as was the reintroduction of conscription. and annoucing rearmament with it."
