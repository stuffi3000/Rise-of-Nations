 hungary_flavor_ger.20.d:0 "The old regent of Hungary is looking for a successor to his post, and the crown prince of the former German Empire, Wilhelm von Hohenzollern is being considered as a candidate. We could prevent him from accepting the request, but having a German in a place of power in Hungary could prove beneficial later."

 hungary_flavor_ger.21.t:0 "Hungary offers recruitable manpower for Burgenland"
 hungary_flavor_ger.21.d:0 "An interesting proposal arrived from Hungary today. They wish to support our army with men from their own, and in return, we would have to cede Burgenland to them. Burgenland is historically Hungarian, though most of its inhabitants are Austrians. Seeing as our war is not going as smoothly as we expected, we could certainly use the extra manpower. What shall we tell them?"

 hungary_flavor_ger.25.t:0 "Hungary proposes Polish Axis membership"
 hungary_flavor_ger.25.d:0 "Our Hungarian allies have been pushing for a strange diplomatic move lately. They wish for us to invite Poland into the Axis. It is well known, that Hungarians and Poles are friends, and Poland has recently adopted a government, that is more in line with ours. Still, inviting Poland could mean, that we will have to renounce any territorial claims towards them, that we still have."
 hungary_flavor_ger.25.a:0 "Good idea. Extend the invitation."
 hungary_flavor_ger.25.b:0 "The Poles aren't our friends."
 
 hungary_flavor_ger.26.t:0 "Poland declines invitation"
 hungary_flavor_ger.26.d:0 "We have sent our diplomats with the invitation to Warsaw, but we expected this to be a token visit, and that Poland would jump at the chance to enter into an alliance that would otherwise threaten them. They instead refused the alliance, stating that their interests go against that of the Axis. This does not bode well for them."
 hungary_flavor_ger.26.a:0 "So we DO have to conquer them after all."
 
 hungary_flavor_ger.27.t:0 "Poland cedes Danzig and Posen"
 hungary_flavor_ger.27.d:0 "Our new allies, the Poles, have responded well to our humble requests. They agreed, that now that we are friends, our interests should not cross each others. We now have full control over Danzig and Posen."
 hungary_flavor_ger.27.a:0 "They have proven that they are loyal to us."
 
 hungary_flavor_ger.28.t:0 "Poland refuses to cede Danzig and Posen"
 hungary_flavor_ger.28.d:0 "The Poles have blatantly refused our request to give us control over Danzig and Posen. They do not seem to understand, that an alliance is built on mutual trust, not on the conflict of intersts."
 hungary_flavor_ger.28.a:0 "Was this alliance a mistake?"
 
 hungary_flavor_ger.29.t:0 "Support from Austria-Hungary"
 hungary_flavor_ger.29.d:0 "Austria-Hungary has helped us with organizing the overthrow of the nazi regime, and they have reassured us of their continued support. With them at our side, we will surely take back the German homeland in no time."
 hungary_flavor_ger.29.a:0 "We welcome the support."
 
 hungary_flavor_ger.30.t:0 "Hungarian state visit"
 hungary_flavor_ger.30.d:0 "Hungary's leader, Ferenc Szálasi, has requested a meeting with the Führer. This meeting has been arranged in Berlin, and the results were rather pleasant. Szálasi pledged his full support for our efforts, and promised to subordinate Hungary to Germany's needs."
 hungary_flavor_ger.30.a:0 "Their obedience is most welcome."
 
 hungary_flavor_ger.31.t:0 "Hungarian state visit"
 hungary_flavor_ger.31.d:0 "Hungary's leader, Ferenc Szálasi, has requested a meeting with the Führer. This meeting has been arranged in Berlin, and the topic was rather controversial. Szálasi requested, that the Hungarian army be given a more prominent role in our frontline operations, and more cooperation between our military commands."
 hungary_flavor_ger.31.a:0 "Sure. Military cooperation benefits both of us."
 hungary_flavor_ger.31.b:0 "Those Hungarians know nothing about running a military."
 
 hungary_flavor_ger.32.t:0 "Hungarian state visit"
 hungary_flavor_ger.32.d:0 "Hungary's leader, Ferenc Szálasi, has requested a meeting with the Führer. This meeting has been arranged in Berlin, with the primary talking points revolving around ideological differences. Szálasi tried to promote the similarities between hungarism and national socialism, with more or less success. The Führer is still undecided about his arguments, but his choice will decide whether the two countries can reconcile their ideological disparities."
 hungary_flavor_ger.32.a:0 "Hungarism you say?"
 hungary_flavor_ger.32.b:0 "We are nothing alike."
 
 hungary_flavor_ger.33.t:0 "Operation Margaretha"
 hungary_flavor_ger.33.d:0 "The preposterous exit attempt of Hungary will be answered with proper recourse. Our troops have made contact with the Hungarist Szálasi government, which is quickly taking over control in Hungary. The remaining defectors and renegades will be hunted down, and brought to justice."
 hungary_flavor_ger.33.a:0 "Hungary will soon be under our control again."

 hungary_flavor_cze.1.d:0 "The revisionist government of Hungary has decided to claim all former Hungarian land. Slovakia, a former province of the Kingdom of Hungary, is in our possession, so they issued their demands to immediately transfer ownership of it.

 hungary_flavor_cze.1.b:0 "Refuse."
 
 hungary_flavor_cze.2.t:0 "Imperialist coup"
 hungary_flavor_cze.2.d:0 "A small group of people, who still support the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, have stormed Prague, and seized control over the government. The military leadership of the country was either bribed, or is just shocked into inaction, as the coup did not meet much resistance. The imperialists certainly had foreign support, and the prime suspect is the neighboring Austro-Hungarian Empire. Who would have thought?"
 hungary_flavor_cze.2.a:0 "Long live the Habsburgs... I guess."
 
 hungary_flavor_cze.3.t:0 "Merge with Austria-Hungary"
 hungary_flavor_cze.3.d:0 "Now that Austria-Hungary has reemerged, they seek to restore their old territory. Our country has entirely been part of the Empire, and as expected, they invited us to rejoin their fold. We would enjoy the protection of a much larger country, but we would be subjects to other nations yet again."
 hungary_flavor_cze.3.a:0 "We need their protection."
 hungary_flavor_cze.3.a:0 "What an absurd proposition."
 
 hungary_flavor_cze.4.t:0 "Alliance Austria-Hungary"

 hungary_flavor_cze.5.d:0 "Austria-Hungary has resurfaced, and with it, the threats of subjugation as well. Although our relations with the other members of the Little Entente have deteriorated somewhat, we must not forget the reason we bound together in the first place. The restoration of the Habsburgs has to be prevented at all costs, so we should tighten our relationship with Romania and Yugoslavia, to defend ourselves."
 hungary_flavor_cze.5.d_2:0 "Hungary has announced their claims on all of their lost territory, and that includes most of our country. Although our relations with the other members of the Little Entente have deteriorated somewhat, we must not forget the reason we bound together in the first place. The expansion of Hungary has to be limited at all costs, so we should tighten our relationship with Romania and Yugoslavia, to defend ourselves."
 hungary_flavor_cze.5.a:0 "Send emissaries to Romania and Yugoslavia."
 hungary_flavor_cze.5.b:0 "The Little Entente is but a long forgotten dream. We can do nothing."
 
 hungary_flavor_cze.6.t:0 "Fate of the Little Entente"
 hungary_flavor_cze.6.d_both:0 "We can rest easy, as the entirety of the Little Entente is behind us now. Both Romania and Yugoslavia have agreed to reinforce our alliance, and isolate this new threat as much as we can."
 hungary_flavor_cze.6.d_rom:0 "Romania has answered our call, and decided to stand with us against the threats we face. Yugoslavia can be consumed by it for all we care, but it would have been best if they too listened to reason."
 hungary_flavor_cze.6.d_yug:0 "Yugoslavia has answered our call, and decided to stand with us against the threats we face. Perhaps this will be enough to stop the war-hungry beast between our borders, but our efforts might be too little, too late."
 hungary_flavor_cze.6.d_neither:0 "Our calls have gone unheard. Romania and Yugoslavia decided that our alliance is not worth enough, for them to take action against the threats ahead. But if we will not contain it, who will?"
 hungary_flavor_cze.6.a:0 "We will stop this menace together!"
 hungary_flavor_cze.6.b:0 "At least Romania stands with us."
 hungary_flavor_cze.6.b:0 "At least our southern brothers stand with us."
 hungary_flavor_cze.6.b:0 "This is a big disappointment for our nation."
 
 hungary_flavor_cze.7.t:0 "Slovakian-Hungarian small war"
 hungary_flavor_cze.7.d:0 "In these time of troubles, our country faced yet another danger. The Hungarians have attacked us from the east, seeking to expand their newly gained territroy. Though the attack took us unawares, we eventually managed to push them back, almost to where they started from. Hostilities have ceased, and only a few dozen died on both sides, while we lost very little land in the process. The Hungarians have been halted, and our nation defended!"
 hungary_flavor_cze.7.a:0 "We have successfully stopped Hungarian aggression."
 hungary_flavor_cze.7.b:0 "We will retake that land, and more!"
 
 hungary_flavor_cze.8.t:0 "Hungary asks for a referendum in Southern Slovakia"
 hungary_flavor_cze.8.d:0 "Although Hungary now has a democratic leadership, it would seem that they have not given up on regaining old territory. They ask, that we hold a referendum in Southern Slovakia, and let the people decide, whether they want to stay in Czechoslovakia, or join Hungary. The results would likely go their way, but disallowing the referendum would make us look undemocratic in the eyes of some."
 hungary_flavor_cze.8.a:0 "Allow the referendum."
 hungary_flavor_cze.8.b:0 "Southern Slovakia is ours, and always will be."
 
 hungary_flavor_cze.9.t:0 "Hungary forces through Southern Slovakian referendum"
 hungary_flavor_cze.9.d:0 "Even though we refused to hold the Southern Slovakian referendum, Hungary used their influence in [Root.GetFactionName], and forced our hand.

 hungary_flavor.1.d:0 "Welcome!\nThis mod aims to make playing Hungary a more enjoyable experience. However, historically, Hungary's options were very limited during this time-period, so a realistic representation of the country would not necessarily be fun for everyone. If you wish to play Hungary in a less challenging scenario, choose the 'Non-realistic version', and if you want a more realistic, challenging experience, choose the 'Realistic version'. Note, that choosing the Non-realistic version will mostly only influence event outcomes (eg. territorial demands), and have very little effect on quantitative gameplay elements (like number of factories or divisions)."

 hungary_flavor.46.t:0 "Austria disallows Burgenland referendum"
 hungary_flavor.46.d:0 "The Austrian government has declined the proposed referendum for Burgenland. If they were not allies of Hungary, this would be considered as an act of offense, and would be dealt with in kind. This may well end up tearing our faction apart."
 hungary_flavor.46.a:0 "Disappointing."
 hungary_flavor.46.b:0 "Very well. We shall take it by force."
 
 hungary_flavor.47.t:0 "Slovenia for Burgenland"
 hungary_flavor.47.d:0 "We have acquired Slovenia in the recent years, and Austria still holds the old Hungarian province of Burgenland. It would make sense to exchange these territories between the two countries, and restore historical borders. Will we make this offer to Austria?"

 hungary_flavor.47.b:0 "The borders are good just the way they are."
 
 hungary_flavor.48.t:0 "Austria accepts Slovenian trade"
 hungary_flavor.48.d:0 "Austria made the sensible decision to accept Slovenia in exchange for Burgenland. Both states have been restored to their historical owners."
 hungary_flavor.48.a:0 "Very well."
 
 hungary_flavor.49.t:0 "Austria declines Slovenian trade"
 hungary_flavor.49.d:0 "It may come as a surprise, but Austria refused to cede Burgenland in return for Slovenia. The territorial gains would certainly have outweighed the losses, and they would have regained a province that is traditionally theirs."
 hungary_flavor.49.a:0 "Strange."

 hungary_flavor.50.d:0 "As our armament efforts were limited for a long time, due to the peace agreements after the Great War, the [Root.GetAdjective] army is in dire need of modernisation. A rearmament plan developed by Béla Imrédy proposes a thorough reformation and restructuration of not just the army, but the industry of the country. The total cost of the execution would be a billion Hungarian Pengös, 400 millions of which would go towards defense, and insutry development, while 600 million would go directly to the army, and research.

 hungary_flavor.51.t:0 "Györi Program: Phase I is ready"
 hungary_flavor.51.d:0 "The first phase of the Györi Program is ready to be put into action. Research, and industrial development are the primary focuses of this part of the plan, thus many construction grants and research agreements have been negotiated to this end.

 hungary_flavor.51.a:0 "[Root.GetName] will prevail."
 
 hungary_flavor.52.t:0 "Györi Program: Phase II is ready"
 hungary_flavor.52.d:0 "The second phase of the Györi Program is now ready to be put into action. The focus of the plan now shifts towards the army, and defense efforts. A modernisation of the army, and the protection of our borders are in order, if we want to survive any military conflict."
 hungary_flavor.52.a:0 "Our army shall be the best."
 
 hungary_flavor.53.t:0 "Györi Program: Phase III is ready"
 hungary_flavor.53.d:0 "The third phase of the Györi Program is ready to be executed. The national aviation effort is far behind that of the surrounding countries, and as such, deserves special attention during the plan. We need to spend every effort to develop new aircraft models, and put them through production."
 hungary_flavor.53.a:0 "The skies will know the might of [Root.GetName]."
 
 hungary_flavor.54.t:0 "Györi Program: Phase IV is ready"
 hungary_flavor.54.d:0 "The fourth, and final phase of the Györi Program focuses on the navy. Initially, the navy was not included in the plan, due to lack of any ports in the country. Some extra funds have enabled us to invest in naval development, and production."
 hungary_flavor.54.a:0 "The navy shall be great once again."
 
 hungary_flavor.55.t:0 "[Root.GetAdjective]-Yugoslavian Eternal Friendship"
 hungary_flavor.55.d:0 "The Pact of Eternal Friendship between [Root.GetName] and Yugoslavia has been signed, officially cementing the good relations, and cooperation between the two countries. This might be the beginning of an alliance, that might help defend both nations from foreign threats."
 hungary_flavor.55.a:0 "Excellent."
 
 hungary_flavor.56.t:0 "Yugoslavia declines Eternal Friendship"
 hungary_flavor.56.d:0 "Perhaps still feeling threatened by the possibility of revisionist claims from [Root.GetName], Yugoslavia has dismissed the idea of cooperation between our countries. Surely, this is not meant as an act of hostility, merely a sign of caution on their behalf."
 hungary_flavor.56.a:0 "A shame."
 
 hungary_flavor.57.t:0 "Territorial settlement with Yugoslavia"
 hungary_flavor.57.d:0 "Though we have declared our friensdhip with Yugoslavia, there is still the question of our territorial disputes. Novi Sad clearly belongs to us, and Yugoslavia needs our help, if it is to succeed in future endavours. We promise them help in the future, if they cede Vojvodina to us, as a sign of friendship."
 hungary_flavor.57.a:0 "They will surely agree that Novi Sad is Hungarian."
 hungary_flavor.57.b:0 "We cannot risk the good relations with them for territorial gains."
 
 hungary_flavor.58.t:0 "Successful negotiations with Yugoslavia"
 hungary_flavor.58.d:0 "Yugoslavia has accepted our proposal, and handed over control of Novi Sad. They clearly take our friendship seriously, and rightly so. We will make right on our promises, and support their political efforts."
 hungary_flavor.58.a:0 "A fruit of the friendship between our countries."
 
 hungary_flavor.59.t:0 "Unsuccessful negotiations with Yugoslavia"
 hungary_flavor.59.d:0 "Yugoslavia has understandably refused to cede Novi Sad. We offered little in return, and their territorial integrity is backed by the Allies. The friendship between our countries might not yet come to an end, but everybody left the negotiating table with a sour taste in their mouths."
 hungary_flavor.59.a:0 "This is bound to hurt our relations with them."
 
 hungary_flavor.60.t:0 "Alliance with Yugoslavia"
 hungary_flavor.60.d:0 "Yugoslavia has proven to be a willing partner in cooperation, and our political views align with theirs. To further strengthen our friendship, we should invite them into our faction, and guarantee to defend one another in conflicts to come."
 hungary_flavor.60.a:0 "Of course, we shall invite them."
 hungary_flavor.60.b:0 "We don't have to drag them into this."
 
 hungary_flavor.61.t:0 "Yugoslavia accepts alliance"
 hungary_flavor.61.d:0 "The Treaty of Eternal Friendship between [Root.GetName] and Yugoslavia has been extended to include a military alliance. They have joined our faction, and will now enjoy our protection, just as we will enjoy their help."
 hungary_flavor.61.a:0 "A toast to our friendship!"
 
 hungary_flavor.62.t:0 "Yugoslavia declines alliance"
 hungary_flavor.62.d:0 "The negotiations about an alliance with Yugoslavia have been a failure. They outright rejected the proposal, not wanting to get involved in any of our political struggles. It would seem that they value their neutrality too much."
 hungary_flavor.62.a:0 "They don't know what they're missing out on."
 
 hungary_flavor.63.t:0 "Funding for the Györi Program"
 hungary_flavor.63.d:0 "Some investors have approached the governmental coordinators, responsible for the execution of the Györi Program. They expressed their interest in the success of the armament, as they own stocks of various industrial concerns affected. These investors are willing to provide funding for the program, in the form of generous, low-interest loans."
 hungary_flavor.63.a:0 "Money is always welcome."
 
 hungary_flavor.64.t:0 "Italy accepts demands"
 hungary_flavor.64.d:0 "Italy made the sensible decision to accept the Greek territories in return for giving up the Austro-Hungarian ones. Maybe they only did it to keep the peace, maybe they misjudged the value of the provinces. Whichever the case, the deal is sealed."
 hungary_flavor.64.a:0 "Surprising, but welcome news."
 
 hungary_flavor.65.t:0 "Italy declines demands"
 hungary_flavor.65.d:0 "Unsurprisingly, Italy has refused to relinquish control over our former territory. The promise of Greek territories was not enough to convince them, and they fail to see the true strength of our nation. Our former territories remain in Italian hands."
 hungary_flavor.65.a:0 "It's a shame we will have to take them by force."
 
 hungary_flavor.66.t:0 "Germany opposes Austro-Hungarian cooperation"
 hungary_flavor.66.d:0 "Our effort to restore Austria-Hungary have not gone unnoticed, and Germany is ready to take action against them. If we do not cease negotiations with Austria, they threaten military intervention, if necessary."
 hungary_flavor.66.a:0 "Continue negotiations."
 hungary_flavor.66.b:0 "Back down."
 
 hungary_flavor.67.t:0 "The capital of Austria-Hungary"
 hungary_flavor.67.d:0 "The monarchy of Austria-Hungary has been restored, but historically, she had her capital in Vienna. Granted that the union was originally under Austrian leadership, and now it is under Hungarian, it might still be strategically beneficial, to move the capital to Vienna.\n\nMoving the capital to Vienna would change the country's map color to white."
 hungary_flavor.67.a:0 "We'll stick with Budapest."
 hungary_flavor.67.b:0 "Vienna it is."
 
 hungary_flavor.78.t:0 "Possible exit attempt"
 hungary_flavor.78.d:0 "As the war is turning more and more in the favor of our enemy, it might be time to plan our exit from the war. As Bismarck once said, 'No nation ought to sacrifice itself on the altar of an alliance'."

 hungary_flavor.80.d:0 "Arrangements were made to withdraw all Hungarian forces from potential danger, and a Soviet-friendly government has been set up. Everything is set for our exit attempt, now we have to hope for the best and trust in our new allies to defend us against Germany."
 hungary_flavor.80.a:0 "We have made our choice."
 
 hungary_flavor.81.t:0 "Soviets rebuff exit attempt"

 hungary_flavor.83.t:0 "Joining the Allies"
 hungary_flavor.83.d:0 "Arrangements were made to withdraw all Hungarian forces from potential danger, and a temporary government has been set up. Everything is set for our exit attempt, now we have to hope for the best and trust in our new allies to defend us against Germany."
 hungary_flavor.83.a:0 "We have made our choice."

 hungary_flavor.85.t:0 "The Arrow Cross Party"
 hungary_flavor.85.d:0 "An unexpected turn of events has caused great commotion in the country. German forces have crossed the border, and occupied key facilities, including administrative buildings in the capital. The previous government has been replaced with the fascist Arrow Cross Party, led by Ferenc Szálasi, which took control of the country immediately. This is most likely the German's way of saying they don't trust us to follow their lead."
 hungary_flavor.85.a:0 "There is nothing we can do."
 hungary_flavor.85.b:0 "Get ready to fight!"
 hungary_flavor.85.tt:0 "The Arrow Cross Party will become the ruling party, with Ferenc Szálasi as its head.\n"

 hungary_flavor.86.d:0 "Our threat proved to be enough to scare the Romanians. All of their forces were withdrawn from the borders, leaving Banat free to be annexed by us."
 hungary_flavor.86.a:0 "The cowards flee, and the brave conquer."
 
 hungary_flavor.87.t:0 "Romania refuses to withdraw from Banat"
 hungary_flavor.87.d:0 "The threat was not enough to coerce Romania into ceding Banat. We can now declare war over the territory, or back down. Not declaring would make us seem weak internationally, as we have made explicit threats stating the opposite."

 hungary_flavor.87.b:0 "We won't waste sweat and blood for such a small piece of land."
 
 hungary_flavor.88.t:0 "Turkey accepts alliance"
 hungary_flavor.88.d:0 "The agreement has been signed, Turkey is now officially a member of [Root.GetFactionName]. In the event of a war, the two countries will now stand, or fall together."
 hungary_flavor.88.a:0 "This is an important step in the right direction."
 
 hungary_flavor.89.t:0 "Turkey declines alliance"
 hungary_flavor.89.d:0 "Perhaps the new Turkish state has lost all of its pride, or desire for greatness, because they decided to stay out of our faction, and be left out of all the glory and rewards that would have come with it."
 hungary_flavor.89.a:0 "We are better off without them anyway."
 
 hungary_flavor.90.t:0 "Support for democratic elections in Hungary"
 hungary_flavor.90.d:0 "Liberal ideas have taken hold of the country, and support for democratic elections is on the rise. We better prepare for a change in government."
 hungary_flavor.90.a:0 "What a time to be alive."
 
 hungary_flavor.91.t:0 "Support for communism in Hungary"
 hungary_flavor.91.d:0 "Worker unions are organising protests and strikes countrywide, while the communist party is preparing to set up a new government. Either through elections, or a forceful rebellion, communism will eventually grab hold of the power in Hungary."
 hungary_flavor.91.a:0 "What a time to be alive."
 
 hungary_flavor.92.t:0 "Miklós Horthy: Regent, or King"
 hungary_flavor.92.d:0 "It is no secret, that our regent, Miklós Horthy, would like his son to succeed him, effectively starting a new ruling dynasty in Hungary. There is some support for crowning him King of Hungary, which would finally put an end to the regency, though some might see this as an undemocratic move. Will we support his claim to the throne?"
 hungary_flavor.92.a:0 "We will not assist in creating another dynasty."
 hungary_flavor.92.b:0 "Long live the King!"
 
 hungary_flavor.93.t:0 "Reinstatement of Miklós Horthy"
 hungary_flavor.93.d:0 "Miklós Horthy will be reinstated as commander of our new navy, the only question is what his role should be. Should he become an admiral again, or rather direct our naval effort from the back, as chief of navy?"
 hungary_flavor.93.a:0 "Horthy will become the chief of navy."
 hungary_flavor.93.b:0 "He will be reestablished as an admiral."
 
 hungary_flavor.94.t:0 "Germany agrees to help"
 hungary_flavor.94.d:0 "Not only did Germany agree to sending a delegation to aid us, they also transferred two of their generals to lead our troops. This is a massive success, and an important milestone in the cooperation of our nations."
 hungary_flavor.94.d_2:0 "Germany agreed to send the delegation we asked for. Part of the General Staff will now be directing the military efforts of Hungary, and aiding our high command."
 hungary_flavor.94.a:0 "Wonderful news."
 hungary_flavor.94.b:0 "Wonderful news."
 hungary_flavor.94.tt:0 "Generals Erwin von Witzleben and Wilhelm Ritter von Leeb will report for duty."
 
 hungary_flavor.95.t:0 "Germany refuses to help"
 hungary_flavor.95.d:0 "For some strange reason, Germany declined our request for closer cooperation. We will have to rely on our own military staff to direct the coordination of the army."
 hungary_flavor.95.a:0 "This is disappointing, to say the least."
 
 hungary_flavor.96.t:0 "Turkish troop exchange"
 hungary_flavor.96.d:0 "Turkey agreed to the troop exchange program. We will shortly be greeting the brigades that they sent us, and our divisions are already on their way to Istanbul."
 hungary_flavor.96.a:0 "This will bring our nations even closer to one another."
 hungary_flavor.96.tt:0 "We will receive two infantry divisions from Turkey.\n"
 
 hungary_flavor.97.t:0 "Turkey declines troop exchange proposal"
 hungary_flavor.97.d:0 "The Turkish government rejected our offer of troop exchange, probably due to the risk they would be putting their soldiers in. Perhaps it is best that we both stick to our own armies."
 hungary_flavor.97.a:0 "They surely have their reasons."
 
 hungary_flavor.98.t:0 "Trianon restrictions invalidated"
 hungary_flavor.98.d:0 "As we are now part of an alliance, no one can enforce the restrictions set by the allies after the Great War anymore. Our friends will protect our right to arm ourselves. While foreign powers might still try to interfere in our expansion, at least the technical retrictions set by the treaty no longer apply."
 hungary_flavor.98.d_2:0 "The military restrictions set by the allies after the Great War are long forgotten, even by those who set them. In today's ever-changing political climate, such a restriction can not be enforced anymore. While foreign powers might still try to interfere in our expansion, at least the technical retrictions set by the treaty no longer apply."
 hungary_flavor.98.a:0 "Together we are strong."
 hungary_flavor.98.b:0 "Were those restrictions still valid? I didn't notice."
 
 hungary_flavor.99.t:0 "Györi program goes against Trianon restrictions"
 hungary_flavor.99.d:0 "The armament program we started is openly violating the military restrictions set by the allies at Trianon. We are not supposed to research, or manufacture artillery, armored vehicles, and aircraft. We could try to keep to these boundaries, and still continue with the program, but it would slow our efforts noticeably."
 hungary_flavor.99.a:0 "We will openly disobey the constraints."
 hungary_flavor.99.b:0 "Perform the restricted research in secret."
 hungary_flavor.99.c:0 "Try our best to stay within the boundaries."
 hungary_flavor.99.tt:0 "The progress of the Györi Program will be slightly hindered."
 
 hungary_flavor.100.t:0 "The Visegrád Group"
 hungary_flavor.100.d_both:0 "Success! Both Czechoslovakia, and Poland have agreed to enter the Visegrád group. This is the beginning of a fruitful alliance."
 hungary_flavor.100.d_cze:0 "Only Czechoslovakia agreed to enter our alliance. Nevertheless, the faction will be formed, even if only with two founding members."
 hungary_flavor.100.d_pol:0 "Only Poland agreed to enter our alliance. Nevertheless, the faction will be formed, even if only with two founding members."
 hungary_flavor.100.d_neither:0 "Disaster! Neither Czechoslovakia, nor Poland entered the proposed alliance. We are left alone in our fight."
 hungary_flavor.100.a:0 "The Visegrád Triangle is strong."
 hungary_flavor.100.b:0 "We will build a strong alliance with Czechoslovakia."
 hungary_flavor.100.c:0 "At least our Polish friends are willing to join."
 hungary_flavor.100.e:0 "It seems this alliance died before it could be born."
 
 hungary_flavor.101.t:0 "Baltic expansion of the Visegrád Group"
 hungary_flavor.101.d_all:0 "The expansion has been a full-blown success! All three candidates have accepted the invitation. This is certainly cause for celebration."
 hungary_flavor.101.d_some:0 "The Baltic expansion has been a partial success. We could not convince all Baltic states to join, but the alliance expands nevertheless."
 hungary_flavor.101.d:0 "The Baltic expansion has been a partial success. We could not convince all Baltic states to join, but the alliance expands nevertheless."
 hungary_flavor.101.d_none:0 "The Baltic states have all rejected our request. It seems we must look elsewhere, if we still wish to expand the alliance."
 hungary_flavor.101.a:0 "Let us welcome the new members."
 hungary_flavor.101.b:0 "Let us welcome the new members."
 hungary_flavor.101.c:0 "A disappointing result."
 
 hungary_flavor.102.t:0 "Federalisation of Austria-Hungary"
 hungary_flavor.102.d:0 "The decision has been made. Austria-Hungary will be turned into a federation, with 6 member states: Austria, Hungary, Bohemia, Galicia-Lodomeria, Transylvania, and Jugoslavia. Some states will have subdivisions, where the ethnic borders necessitate it, but for the most part, these will be the self-governing regions of the federation. All states will have appointed representatives, which will participate in a council, that is supervised by the monarch."
 hungary_flavor.102.d_no_galicia:0 "The decision has been made. Austria-Hungary will be turned into a federation, with 5 member states: Austria, Hungary, Bohemia, Transylvania, and Jugoslavia. Some states will have subdivisions, where the ethnic borders necessitate it, but for the most part, these will be the self-governing regions of the federation. All states will have appointed representatives, which will participate in a council, that is supervised by the monarch."
 hungary_flavor.102.a:0 "It shall be called the Austro-Hungarian Federation."
 hungary_flavor.102.b:0 "It shall be called the Danubian Federation."
 hungary_flavor.102.c:0 "Let's call it the United States of Greater Hungary."
 
 hungary_flavor.103.t:0 "Albania wants to join our faction"
 hungary_flavor.103.d:0 "After the successful partition of Yugoslavia, Albania has approached us with a request to join our faction. Perhaps they mistook our generosity regarding the state of Montenegro, for an act of friendship. At any rate, we have to deal with their request. What is our response?"
 hungary_flavor.103.a:0 "We will accept their request."
 hungary_flavor.103.b:0 "Is it not enough that we gave them Montenegro?"
 
 hungary_flavor.104.t:0 "Germany offers Carpathian Ruthenia"
 hungary_flavor.104.d:0 "Germany has now annexed Bohemia, and the Czechoslovakian state is falling to pieces. They do not have explicit plans of their own for Carpathian Ruthenia, which means we could simply invade it without any real consequences. We could let the small territory be self-governed, but taking it would be an important step towards reclaiming our old territory."
 hungary_flavor.104.a:0 "Annex Carpathian Ruthenia."
 hungary_flavor.104.b:0 "We don't care about borders."
 
 hungary_flavor.105.t:0 "Italian Alliance"
 hungary_flavor.105.d:0 "After the Yugoslavian conference was over, Italian ambassadors have approached our delegation with a proposal. In return for giving in to their claims in Yugoslavia, they are willing to join our alliance, and join forces with us."
 hungary_flavor.105.a:0 "Welcome them to our faction."
 hungary_flavor.105.b:0 "Politely refuse their initiative."
 
 hungary_flavor.106.t:0 "Hungarian-Slovakian Small War"
 hungary_flavor.106.d:0 "Our borders with Slovakia were not strictly defined after the annexation of Carpathian Ruthenia. In an attempt to secure the valley of Ung, our forces have launched an offensive against Slovakia from the west, taking minimal losses. Slovakians withdrew from the region, but shortly launched a counterattack, retaking some of the lost territory. The entire skirmish lasted for a few days, and ended with a couple dozen dead on both sides. Still, we can consider this a success, and put a positive spin on it in propaganda pieces."
 hungary_flavor.106.a:0 "A great success for out nation."
 
 hungary_flavor.107.t:0 "Czechoslovakia allows referendum"
 hungary_flavor.107.d:0 "Czechoslovakia has agreed to the proposed referendum. The people of Southern Slovakia can finally decide, where they want to belong."
 hungary_flavor.107.a:0 "Let us hope for favorable results."
 
 hungary_flavor.108.t:0 "Czechoslovakia disallows referendum"
 hungary_flavor.108.d:0 "Czechoslovakia refused to host the referendum for Southern Slovakia. Relations between our countries have not deteriorated, but this is bound to drive a wedge between us in the future."
 hungary_flavor.108.a:0 "They can't deny our right to it forever."
 hungary_flavor.108.b:0 "Use our influence in the faction to force the referendum."
 
 hungary_flavor.109.t:0 "Yugoslavia enters the Visegrád Group"
 hungary_flavor.109.d:0 "After the formation of the Visegrád Group, it was dubious at first, whether the alliance was strong enough to defend itself, let alone expand its influence. Yugoslavia has just announced its entry into the group, massively strengthening its influence in the region. This means that the Visegrád Group is no longer just a petty pact of nations, but a force to be reckoned with in the playing field of Europe."
 hungary_flavor.109.a:0 "A resounding success for the alliance."
 
 hungary_flavor.110.t:0 "Yugoslavia declines invitation"
 hungary_flavor.110.d:0 "The negotiations with Yugoslavia failed. We did not manage to convince them to join the Visegrád Group, and thus, our influence remains limited in the Balkans."
 hungary_flavor.110.a:0 "They don't know what they are missing."
 
 hungary_flavor.111.t:0 "Yugoslavia agrees to border changes"
 hungary_flavor.111.d:0 "During the settlement negotiations with Yugoslavia, it was agreed upon, that the Hungarian people needed to be kept on Hungarian soil. We managed to settle on which regions shall remain part of Yugoslavia, and which would become part of Hungary again. We have regained important land, with significant Hungarian population."
 hungary_flavor.111.a:0 "And yet, no blood needed to be shed."
 
 hungary_flavor.112.t:0 "Yugoslavia agrees to partial border change"
 hungary_flavor.112.d:0 "The negotiations were frought with arguments for both sides, and eventually, a compromise was reached. Some Hungarian population is to be transferred to Hungarian soil, and the territory of Prekmurje will be given to Hungary. This is not all that we hoped for, but at least the effort was not entirely in vain."
 hungary_flavor.112.a:0 "A fair agreement nonetheless."
 
 hungary_flavor.113.t:0 "Yugoslavia refuses to change borders"
 hungary_flavor.113.d:0 "The Yugoslavian government made it clear, that ceding territory was out of the question. They would not make any concessions, and they will defend the sovereignty of their nation by all means necessary. The negotiations achieved nothing."
 hungary_flavor.113.a:0 "A waste of effort."
 
 hungary_flavor.114.t:0 "Germany offers the rest of Vojvodina"
 hungary_flavor.114.d:0 "We already own Backa, which has the most Hungarians in Vojvodina, but Germany has offered the rest of it, as a sing of goodwill. Will we take their offer?"
 hungary_flavor.114.a:0 "Of course."
 hungary_flavor.114.b:0 "We have no need of those lands."
 
 hungary_flavor.115.t:0 "Meeting in Berlin"
 hungary_flavor.115.d:0 "Hitler has arranged to meet our regent, Miklós Horthy in Berlin, to discuss an important matter. He seeks to divide Czechoslovakia with Hungary, and wanted to know what role Hungary would play in this. If we were to play the role of aggressor, he might even give us the entirety of Slovakia, but we could settle for less if we wanted to."
 hungary_flavor.115.a:0 "We want no part of this."
 hungary_flavor.115.b:0 "We will be content with Carpathian Ruthenia."
 hungary_flavor.115.c:0 "We offer full cooperation, if they give us Slovakia."
 
 hungary_flavor.116.t:0 "Hitler agrees to our request"
 hungary_flavor.116.d:0 "The meeting was concluded, and Horthy has agreed with Hitler on the terms of our involvement in the partition of Czechoslovakia. We should now make preparations to fulfill our end of the bargain."
 hungary_flavor.116.a:0 "A successful meeting."
 
 hungary_flavor.117.t:0 "Inconclusive meeting"
 hungary_flavor.117.d:0 "After much discussion, there was no agreement in what Hungary will get after the partition. Hitler made no promises about our territorial gains."
 hungary_flavor.117.a:0 "We shall still hope for the best of outcomes."
 
 hungary_flavor.118.t:0 "Finland accepts alliance"
 hungary_flavor.118.d:0 "Finland has hastily signed the alliance that we proposed. They now expect us to immediately declare war on the Soviet Union, and help defend their country."
 hungary_flavor.118.a:0 "Together we will beat the commies!"
 
 hungary_flavor.119.t:0 "Finland declines alliance"
 hungary_flavor.119.d:0 "Suprisingly, Finland has rejected our proposal, eliminating the possibility, that our alliance comes to their aid. They are now surely doomed, for they alone can not stop the Soviet Union."
 hungary_flavor.119.a:0 "They will perish without us."
 
 hungary_flavor.120.t:0 "Peace with Britain"
 hungary_flavor.120.d:0 "We have now accomplished everything we set out to do, as our borders have been restored. The United Kingdom thought that they could contain our expansion by declaring war against us, and they have obviously failed. However, a drawn out war could hurt us just as much as it could hurt them, so it may benefit us to seek peace with them. They have bigger things to worry about, and we are content with what we have accomplished."
 hungary_flavor.120.a:0 "Send the peace offer."
 hungary_flavor.120.b:0 "We are not done with this war yet."
 
 hungary_flavor.121.t:0 "Britain accepts"
 hungary_flavor.121.d:0 "The United Kingdom has accepted the peace offer we sent. We returned all territory that was not claimed by us, and singed a peace treaty with them and their allies, officially nullifying the Treaty of Trianon."
 hungary_flavor.121.a:0 "Peace at last."
 
 hungary_flavor.122.t:0 "The war continues"
 hungary_flavor.122.d:0 "The United Kingdom refused our peace terms, so the war goes on as if nothing happened. Seems like we will need to use more conventional means to convince them to stop."
 hungary_flavor.122.a:0 "They will regret not signing the peace now."
 
 hungary_flavor.123.t:0 "Slovakian self-governance"
 hungary_flavor.123.d:0 "We have now acquired all Slovakian lands, and though they belonged to [Root.GetName] originally, there are those who propose the establishment of a Slovakian government, that would still answer to us, but would have some degree of independence. We could decide freely, which lands this new Slovakia would get, so we would be free to keep all lands, that are primarily inhabited by Hungarians."
 hungary_flavor.123.a:0 "We will not set up a new government."
 hungary_flavor.123.b:0 "Set up all of Slovakia as a puppet state."
 hungary_flavor.123.c:0 "Set up Northern Slovakia as a puppet state."
 
 hungary_flavor.124.t:0 "Claims on Yugoslavia"
 hungary_flavor.124.d:0 "Now that we have signed the pact of friendship with Yugoslavia, it is time to consider our territorial claims towards them. We could renounce all claims towards them, as a sign of friendship, or we could hold on to our claims on Hungarian-inhabited lands, in hopes of a future settlement with Yugoslavia."
 hungary_flavor.124.a:0 "We will renounce all claims towards Yugoslavia."
 hungary_flavor.124.b:0 "We still want the territories, that have a Hungarian majority."
 hungary_flavor.124.c:0 "We will not be renouncing any claims." 
 
 hungary_flavor.125.t:0 "Claims on Croatia"
 hungary_flavor.125.d:0 "Croatia is now its own state, having been separated from Yugoslavia. While we do still have territorial claims towards them, it might be the smart choice to abandon these claims, and instead seek friendship with Croatia."
 hungary_flavor.125.a:0 "We will renounce all claims towards Croatia."
 hungary_flavor.125.b:0 "We maintain all claims towards Croatia."
 
 hungary_flavor.126.t:0 "The Second Hungarian Republic"
 hungary_flavor.126.d:0 "Today, [ROOT.GetLeader] has officially announced the abolition the Hungarian monarchy. The country was without a king or queen for a long time, and the long years of regency have crippled the nation. From this day on, the people of Hungary will choose their own leaders democratically."
 hungary_flavor.126.a:0 "Long live the republic!"
 
 hungary_flavor.127.t:0 "Fight for Transylvania"
 hungary_flavor.127.d:0 "Romania has taken sides in the current conflict, and is now at war with the Allies. If we want to, we could offer our help against Romania, in return for a promise, that we will get Transylvania at the end of the war. It is a risky proposal, as the English have not exactly been supportive of our territorial revision, but should they agree, we could end up restoring the entirety of Transylvania to our country."
 hungary_flavor.127.a:0 "Offer our help in return for Transylvania."
 hungary_flavor.127.b:0 "Try to stay neutral as long as possible."
 
 hungary_flavor.128.t:0 "United Kingdom refuses help"
 hungary_flavor.128.d:0 "Our proposal was met with resistance from the United Kingdom. They do not want our help, if it comes at the cost of giving us Transylvania."
 hungary_flavor.128.a:0 "We both could have benefited from this."
 
 hungary_flavor.129.t:0 "Austria joins the Visegrád Group"
 hungary_flavor.129.d:0 "The Visegrád Group has a new member: Austria. All treaties have been signed, and Austria is now a full member of the faction."
 hungary_flavor.129.a:0 "Let us welcome them."
 
 hungary_flavor.130.t:0 "Austria truns down alliance offer"
 hungary_flavor.130.d:0 "Austria has refused the helping hand we reached towards them. They do not wish to be part of the Visegrád Group. They will no doubt be swallowed up in the international chaos soon, if they do not align themselves with one faction or the other."
 hungary_flavor.130.a:0 "A real shame."
 
 hungary_flavor.131.t:0 "Romania agrees to cede Southern Dobrudja"
 hungary_flavor.131.d:0 "Although we hoped to accomplish more, we only managed to secure the southern parts of dobrudja for Bulgaria in the negotiations with Romania. We will get the rest eventually, even if we have to pry it from Romania with war."
 hungary_flavor.131.a:0 "We have to be content with this for now."
 
 hungary_flavor.132.t:0 "Romania agrees to cede all of Dobrudja"
 hungary_flavor.132.d:0 "Romania has finally agreed to our demands. Bulgaria is now the owner of all of Dobrudja, greatly decreasing the amount of ethnic Bulgarians, who live in Romania."
 hungary_flavor.132.a:0 "And nobody needed to get hurt."
 
 hungary_flavor.133.t:0 "Romania refuses Bulgarian territorial demands"
 hungary_flavor.133.d:0 "Romania has had the wherewithal to outright refuse our demands for Dobrudja. They do not wish to give an inch of ground to Bulgaria. We will have to convince them otherwise with weapons, no doubt."
 hungary_flavor.133.a:0 "They will live to regret this decision."
 
 hungary_flavor.134.t:0 "Greece accepts alliance proposal"
 hungary_flavor.134.d:0 "Greece has accepted our generous offer of alliance. [ROOT.GetFactionName] is now one member stronger, and the southern reaches of the Balkans are under our influence."
 hungary_flavor.134.a:0 "We grow stronger."
 
 hungary_flavor.135.t:0 "Greece declines alliance proposal"
 hungary_flavor.135.d:0 "The weak nation of Greece has decided they wish to stand alone in the storm that is coming. They declined our invitation into [ROOT.GetFactionName]."

 hungary_flavor.136.d:0 "As per the order of [Root.GetLeader], the [Root.GetAdjective] military has conducted a nation-wide land survey, producing detailed maps for the military leadership. The maps provide detailed information about roads, buildings, geographical features, rivers and lakes, along with any other topographical features that are important to the military."
 hungary_flavor.136.a:0 "Ok."
 
 hungary_flavor.137.t:0 "Germany seeks access through Hungarian lands to Poland"
 hungary_flavor.137.d:0 "Germany is at war with Poland, and they seek to open up a new front in the conflict, by attacking Poland through our lands. We could refuse, but perhaps it would be best to side with the victors here, and just let the German troops pass."
 hungary_flavor.137.a:0 "Let them through."
 hungary_flavor.137.b:0 "We won't betray our Polish friends."
 
 hungary_flavor.138.t:0 "Polish refugees"
 hungary_flavor.138.d:0 "Poland is losing ground against the Germans every day, and the war looks to be decided already. Some Polish troops can no longer retreat through other states to neutral territory, so they asked to pass our borders instead, to join their allies elsewhere. Allowing them through would certainly anger the Germans, but it would be an honorable act in helping our Polish friends."
 hungary_flavor.138.a:0 "Let them in."
 hungary_flavor.138.b:0 "We will not risk the wrath the Germans."
 
 hungary_flavor.139.t:0 "The Zaolzie question"
 hungary_flavor.139.d:0 "Some of our advisors have suggested that we negotiate the transfer of Zaolzie to Poland. Seeing as they are our allies, and the territory in question is under our influence, it would certainly make sense to do so, as there is a significant Polish minority in the area."
 hungary_flavor.139.a:0 "Zaolzie belongs to Poland."
 hungary_flavor.139.b:0 "Things are fine just the way they are."
 
 hungary_flavor.140.t:0 "Germany agrees to Burgenland deal"
 hungary_flavor.140.d:0 "Our offer was welcomed by the German government. We will send them much needed reinforcements, in return for the territory of Burgenland."
 hungary_flavor.140.a:0 "Great news."
 
 hungary_flavor.141.t:0 "Germany refuses Burgenland deal"
 hungary_flavor.141.d:0 "The German government rejected our proposal. It would seem that they would rather see their army suffer, undermanned, than swallow their pride and return Burgenland to us."
 hungary_flavor.141.a:0 "Their pride does them little good now."
 
 hungary_flavor.142.t:0 "Austria-Hungary-Croatia"
 hungary_flavor.142.d:0 "The trialist constitution was signed today, officially declaring the formation of Austria-Hungary-Croatia.

 hungary_flavor.143.d:0 "The skirmishes in the Sobrance region seemed to have come to an end, but today, the [From.GetAdjective] armed forces have launched offensives all along the border. If we manage to win this war, we could very well end up with all of Slovakia."
 hungary_flavor.143.a:0 "To arms!"
 
 hungary_flavor.144.t:0 "Self governance of Carpathian Ukraine"
 hungary_flavor.144.d:0 "We have recently acquired the region of Carpathian Ukraine. This land has historically been part of [ROOT.GetName], but its population is mostly Ruthenian. Local representatives have expressed their desire for autonomy within the country, and giving them self governance could help keep stability in the region. What should we do with Carpathian Ukraine?"
 hungary_flavor.144.a:0 "We will not set up a new government."
 hungary_flavor.144.b:0 "Set up all of Carpathian Ukraine as a puppet state."

They would have an easier time occupying territory, if the local population wouldn't resist them, so we could help them spread propaganda.

 #Leader descriptions
 POLITICS_OTTO_I_AHU_DESC:0 "Otto von Habsburg was Crown Prince of Austria-Hungary in name only, after the empire was dissolved in 1918. In these times of political turmoil, the people of Austria and Hungary have called upon him to unite the two countries once again."
 POLITICS_OTTO_I_HUN_DESC:0 "Otto von Habsburg was Crown Prince of Austria-Hungary in name only, after the empire was dissolved in 1918. As his father, Charles died in 1922, the Kingdom of Hungary has elected him as king, when the need of a new monarch arose."
 POLITICS_FERENC_SZALASI_DESC:0 "Ferenc Szálasi was installed by the German government, to ensure Hungarian loyalty and cooperation during the war."
 POLITICS_MIKLOS_HORTHY_KING_DESC:0 "Miklós Horthy was a rear-admiral of the Austro-Hungarian navy, but after the dissolution of the empire, when the Hungarian Soviet Republic took power, he was one of the organizers of the counter-revolutionary army in Szeged. He played an important role in restoring the Hungarian monarchy, eventually accepting the position of regent. Now he reigns as Hungary's newly elected king, ending a long period of foreign monarchs on the Hungarian throne."
 POLITICS_MATYAS_RAKOSI_DESC:0 "Rákosi was the General Secretary of the Hungarian Communist Party after the second world war ended. His rule was defined by hardcore communism, and a personal cult, similar to that of Stalin. The unofficial motto of his system was 'Whoever is not with us, is against us', as opposed to the later system of János Kádár, which had the friendlier approach of 'Whoever is not against us, is with us'."
 POLITICS_ENDRE_BAJCSY_ZSILINSZKY_DESC:0 "Bajcsy Zsilinszky was a right wing democrat in pre-war Hungary. He was a staunch opposer of Germany's expansionist politics, and detested alignment with Hitler's Axis."
 POLITICS_JANOS_KADAR_DESC:0 "Historically, Kádár was the successor to Mátyás Rákosi, and held slightly different beliefs, than his predecessor. While Rákosi's system was characterized by hardline communism, Kádár's is remembered as "Show-window communism", meaning that it was much like a showcase of communist prosperity towards the west. His rule was loved by many, though the system was not sustainable, due to the enormous loans the country had to take to pay for it."
 POLITICS_ISTVAN_HORTHY_DESC:0 "István Horthy is the son of the former regent, Miklós Horthy. His political views are moderate, but slightly westward leaning. He served in the Hungarian air force as a fighter pilot, and survived a dangerous accident while flying on his last mission."
 POLITICS_ISTVAN_HORTHY_JR_DESC:0 "The son of the late István Horthy, and the grandson of the former regent, Miklós Horthy, the young István is but a child, who has been given an entire country to govern. Currently, he is guided by a council of advisors, who rule in his stead until he comes of age."
 POLITICS_VICTOR_EMMANUEL_DESC:0 "Victor Emmanuel is the king of Italy, and now Hungary. He was chosen to succeed Horthy as a king, and has now assumed that position. His political views are somewhat liberal, though he could not excercise them in Italy, as he was mostly just a figurehead."
 POLITICS_WILHELM_HOHENZOLLERN_HUN_DESC:0 "Wilhelm von Hohenzollern is the crown prince of the old German Empire, and now the king of Hungary as well. He fought in the Great War, and was exiled after the empire lost, but returned to Germany. He was involved in German politics to some extent, but never rose to prominence. Now that he is king of Hungary, he has the ability to guide the fate of a nation, like his father before him."
 POLITICS_BELA_KUN_DESC:0 "Béla Kun was one of the most prominent leaders of the Hungarian Council Republic, that emerged after the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy. With the previous government disbanding the army in the face of the invading Entente powers, the communist republic was doomed to fail. Kun has now returned to Hungary, to once again try to realize this dream of a communist country in the Carpathian Basin."
 POLITICS_MIHALY_KAROLYI_DESC:0 "Mihály Károlyi was the prime minister and president of the Hungarian Council Republic in 1918-1919. After the fall of the short-lived communist state, he emigrated. As a strong critic of the Horthy administration, he was branded an enemy of the state in 1923. After the reestablished, and again defeated communist regime in Hungary, his connections abroad helped him negotiate a place for a government in exile."

 HUN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Hungary became independent during the Great War after a long time of foreign rulership, and thus, master of her own fate again. The Treaty of Trianon left the country with one third of its former territory, and half of its former population. Many would like to see the old borders restored, but the surrounding nations are not at all willing to compromise. There are still supporters of the old Habsburg monarchy, but communist and liberal ideas have also taken root in the country.\n\nThe next few years might very well decide the fate of Hungary for the remainder of the century."
 HUN_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The past few years saw the restoration of Southern Slovakia, and Carpathian Ruthenia to the Kingdom of Hungary. Now, with the assistance of Germany, the government is looking to negotiate the revision of Romanian borders, and it looks like Romania might be willing to cooperate, under German arbitration. Hungary is slowly coming under the influence of The Third Reich, inevitably drawing itself into the coming conflict.\n\n Only time will tell, if Hungary rises from the mud of war victorious, regaining lost territory, or beaten, losing more than ever before."

 HUN_land_reform:0 "Land Reform"
 HUN_land_reform_desc:0 "Many of the farmlands in Hungary still have disputed ownership since the country shrank in size, and crown lands were redistributed.

 HUN_invite_yugoslavia:0 "Invite Yugoslavia"

Hungary is not at all unfamiliar with bolshevik ideals, as the short-lived Hungarian Soviet Republic rose to power in 1919.

The logical choice are the Czechs, as their country serves as the industrial powerhouse of our country, and earning their loyalty is of utmost importance."

 HUN_compromise_with_the_nationalities_desc:0 "If we truly wish to maintain the empire as it is, with its miriad of nationalities, we will have to reach a compromise with all of them.

 HUN_wilsons_10th_point:0 "Wilson's 10th Point"
 HUN_wilsons_10th_point_desc:0 "President Woodrow Wilson had a very different plan for the fate of Austria-Hungary, than what actually came to pass. He wanted to turn it into a federation, in which nationalities had some level of self governance. If we modified the concept a little, we could transform into a federal monarchy, in which the ultimate authority is still the monarch, but regional decisions are delegated to local parliaments."
 HUN_regional_elections:0 "Regional Elections"
 HUN_regional_elections_desc:0 "The federation is considerably more stable, than the monarchy preceding it, but the multinational population is still not quite content with the representation of its interests. Instead of appointed representatives, we could have locally elected representatives, that hold office for four years. This would mean relinquishing some of the control over the politics of our nation, in return for more stability."
 HUN_empires_of_old:0 "Empires Of Old"
 HUN_empires_of_old_desc:0 "There were certain monarchist circles in France in the 1920s, that endorsed the creation of a Central European multi-ethnic monarchy, but their influence wasn't sufficient.

 HUN_remind_the_germans_of_the_glory_days_desc:0 "Most foreign powers opposed the restoration of Austria-Hungary, and they may not tolerate its existence for long. Our old allies in Germany have been turned away from traditional imperialism, but the memory of the glorious German Empire still lives in their hearts. We could try to rally the supporters of the old monarchy around the German crown prince Wilhelm, who is out on the frontlines, fighting."
 HUN_the_kaisers_coup:0 "The Kaiser's Coup"
 HUN_the_kaisers_coup_desc:0 "The crown prince's support has grown large enough, that a coup might be able to succeed. If we helped organize such a coup, we could very well be able to restore the Hohenzollerns to power, and find a new ally in the German Empire."

 HUN_the_bucovina_question_desc:0 "There is small piece of land called Bucovina in the northern corners of Romania. Parts of the population there are Hungarian, which would be reason enough to demand the state, but it is also a historical part of Austria-Hungary.

 HUN_imperialist_coup_in_czechoslovakia_desc:0 "Czechoslovakia is righfully a part of our Empire.

 HUN_merge_with_czechoslovakia_desc:0 "Austria and Hungary have been united, but the restoration of the empire has only just started.

 HUN_demand_italian_provinces_desc:0 "Italy is a proud nation, and despite her past failures, a force to be reckoned with. This is why it might prove difficult to strike a deal with the Italians, and make them return old provinces of the monarchy.

 HUN_military_land_survey:0 "Military Land Survey"
 HUN_military_land_survey_desc:0 "The country has recently grown, and if we want to keep our new territories, we have to be able to defend them.

 HUN_hungarian_ss_desc:0 "We could strike a deal with Germany, and let them conscript Hungarians, and Germans from Hungary into their Waffen SS, in return for some subsidies for our tank production.

 HUN_enact_home_defense_law_desc:0 "The political situation around us is starting to look dangerous.
