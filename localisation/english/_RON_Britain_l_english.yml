  dnc_eng.16.d:0 "Although the Norse had explored and colonized northeastern North America c. 1000 CE, a later and more well known wave of European colonization of the Americas took place in the Americas between about 1500 CE and 1800 CE, during the Age of Exploration. During this period of time, several European empires—primarily Spain, Portugal, Britain, and France—began to explore and claim the natural resources and human capital of the Americas, resulting in the displacement and disestablishment of some Indigenous Nations, and the establishment of several settler-colonial states. Some formerly European settler colonies—including New Mexico, Alaska, the Prairies/northern Great Plains, and the "Northwest Territories" in North America; the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, the Yucatán Peninsula, and the Darién Gap in Central America; and the northwest Amazon, the central Andes, and the Guianas in South America—remain relatively rural, sparsely populated and Indigenous into the 21st century, however several settler-colonial states, including Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Argentina, and the United States grew into settler-colonial empires in their own right. Russia began colonizing the Pacific Northwest, starting in the mid-eighteenth century, seeking pelts for the fur trade. Many of the social structures—including religions, political boundaries, and linguae francae—which predominate the western hemisphere in the 21st century are the descendants of the structures which were established during this period."

  dnc_eng.17.d:0 "The 1900 United Kingdom general election was held between 26 September and 24 October 1900, following the dissolution of Parliament on 25 September. Also referred to as the Khaki Election (the first of several elections to bear this sobriquet), it was held at a time when it was widely believed that the Second Boer War had effectively been won (though in fact it was to continue for another two years). The Conservative Party, led by Lord Salisbury with their Liberal Unionist allies, secured a large majority of 134 seats, despite securing only 5.6% more votes than Henry Campbell-Bannerman's Liberals. This was largely owing to the Conservatives winning 163 seats that were uncontested by others. The Labour Representation Committee, later to become the Labour Party, participated in a general election for the first time. However, it had only been in existence for a few months; as a result, Keir Hardie and Richard Bell were the only LRC Members of Parliament elected in 1900."
  dnc_eng.17.a:0 "The Conservatives Win!"
  
  dnc_eng.18.t:0 "General Election of 1906"
  dnc_eng.18.d:0 "The 1906 United Kingdom general election was held from 12 January to 8 February 1906. The Liberals, led by Prime Minister Henry Campbell-Bannerman, won a landslide majority at the election. The Conservatives led by Arthur Balfour, who had been in government until the month before the election, lost more than half their seats, including party leader Balfour's own seat in Manchester East, leaving the party with its fewest recorded seats ever in history. The election saw a 5.4% swing from the Conservative Party to the Liberal Party, the largest-ever seen at the time (however, if only looking at seats contested in both 1900 and 1906, the Conservative vote fell by 11.6%). This has resulted in the 1906 general election being dubbed the "Liberal landslide", and is now ranked alongside the 1931, 1945, 1983, 1997 and 2001 general elections as one of the largest landslide election victories."

  dnc_eng.19.t:0 "Partition of India"
  dnc_eng.19.d:0 "The Partition of India was the division of British India into two independent Dominions: India and Pakistan. The two states have since gone through further reorganization: the Dominion of India is today the Republic of India; while the Dominion of Pakistan was composed of what is known today as the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and the People's Republic of Bangladesh. The partition involved the division of two provinces, Bengal and Punjab, based on district-wide non-Muslim or Muslim majorities. The partition also saw the division of the British Indian Army, the Royal Indian Navy, the Indian Civil Service, the railways, and the central treasury."
  dnc_eng.19.a:0 "OK"
  
  dnc_eng.20.t:0 "Imperial Conference Held"
  dnc_eng.20.d:0 "The 1902 Colonial Conference followed the conclusion of the Boer War and was held on the occasion of the coronation of Edward VII. As with the previous conference, it was called by Secretary of State for the Colonies Joseph Chamberlain who opened it on 30 June 1902. Chamberlain used the occasion to resubmit his earlier proposals made at the 1897 Colonial Conference for an Imperial Council made up of colonial representatives which would act as a quasi-Imperial Parliament and make decisions for the colonies on imperial policy. This proposal, along with Chamberlain's idea for a unified imperial defence scheme, was rejected by most of the colonial prime ministers. While New Zealand proposed that each colony provide a special force for imperial defence in the case of war, Canada and Australia both believed this idea undermined self-government. Chamberlain also proposed an imperial economic union or customs union with free trade within the empire and tariffs against goods from outside of it. The colonies, however, passed a resolution rejecting imperial free trade. A resolution in favour of imperial preference as proposed by Canada was approved and Chamberlain agreed to bring the idea to the British government. However, this plan was not implemented until the British Empire Economic Conference in 1932."

  dnc_eng.21.d:0 "The Imperial Federation refers to a series of proposals in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to create a federal union to replace the existing British Empire. No such proposal was ever adopted, but various schemes were popular in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and other colonial territories. The project was championed by Unionists such as Joseph Chamberlain as an alternative to William Gladstone's proposals for home rule in Ireland. Many proposals were put forward, but none commanded majority support. The Imperial Federation League, the main advocacy group, split into two factions in 1893, with one group promoting imperial defense and the other encouraging imperial trade. Various proposals were put forward, with most of them calling for a single state with an imperial parliament headquartered in London. The new parliament would deal with internal trade, foreign relations, defense and other issues that affected the entire federation. The new parliament would rule India directly, while the dominions (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Newfoundland, and South Africa) would have internal self government.

  dnc_eng.51.d:0 "The Crusades were a series of religious wars initiated, supported, and sometimes directed by the Latin Church in the medieval period. The best known of these Crusades are those to the Holy Land in the period between 1095 and 1291 that were intended to recover Jerusalem and its surrounding area from Islamic rule. Concurrent military activities in the Iberian Peninsula against the Moors (the Reconquista) and in northern Europe against pagan Slavic tribes (the Northern Crusades) also became known as crusades. Through the 15th century, other church-sanctioned crusades were fought against heretical Christian sects, against the Byzantine and Ottoman empires, to combat paganism and heresy, and for political reasons. Unsanctioned by the church, Popular Crusades of ordinary citizens were also frequent. Beginning with the First Crusade which resulted in the recovery of Jerusalem in 1099, dozens of Crusades were fought, providing a focal point of European history for centuries."

The revolution was initially aimed at overthrowing King Farouk. According to Miles Copeland Jr. and Kermit Roosevelt Jr. It was part of Operation Fat Fucker, aimed at changing to political leadership in Egypt to a more progressive pro-american leadership. However, the movement had more political ambitions, and soon moved to abolish the constitutional monarchy and aristocracy of Egypt and Sudan, establish a republic, end the British occupation of the country, and secure the independence of Sudan (previously governed as an Anglo-Egyptian condominium). The revolutionary government adopted a staunchly nationalist, anti-imperialist agenda, which came to be expressed chiefly through Arab nationalism, and international non-alignment.

The vote was restricted to white South Africans. More than 90% of eligible voters participated in the referendum, and 52.3% of votes were in favour of 'a Republic for the Union.' The Republic of South Africa Constitution Bill was introduced in January 1961. It came into force on 31 May 1961; 31 May was a significant day in South African history, being both the day in 1902 on which the Treaty of Vereeniging was signed, ending the Second Anglo-Boer War, and the day in 1910 on which the Union of South Africa came into being."

Less than a year later, communist guerrillas launched a violent campaign aimed at forcing Britain from Malaya. Thousands were killed, but an effective political and military response prevented a Communist take-over. Malaya became an independent democracy on 31 August 1957. In the Middle East, Britain hurriedly abandoned Palestine in 1948. Ghana became Britain's first African colony to reach independence in 1957. By 1967 more than 20 British territories were independent. Decolonisation was a complex process. Each colony's unique societies presented different political pressures which could sometimes lead to violence ranging from riots to massacres. The Cold War added further complexities, as Britain attempted to insulate former colonies from the influence of the Soviet Union. In 1997 Hong Kong returned to Chinese administration. Though Britain still maintains overseas territories, the handover marked the final end of Britain's empire."

The trigger of the war was the discovery of diamonds and gold in the Boer states. Initial Boer attacks were successful, and although British reinforcements later reversed these, the war continued for years with Boer guerrilla warfare, until harsh British counter-measures including a scorched earth policy brought the Boers to terms."

Under the terms of the agreement, each of the four parties received a 23.75% share of all the crude oil produced by TPC, which was allowed to operate anywhere in the Middle East between the Suez Canal and Iran, with the exception of Kuwait. The aim of the agreement was to formalize the corporate structure of IPC and bind all partners to a "self-denial clause" that prohibited any of its shareholders from independently seeking oil interests in the ex-Ottoman territory. It marked the creation of an oil monopoly, or cartel, of immense influence, spanning a vast territory."

 ### EVENTS
 britain.9.t:0 "Chamberlain Resigns"
 britain.9.d:0 "With the war developing to the detriment of us and our allies, the Prime Minister has come under fire for both his peacetime and wartime decisions at critical junctions. At a moment when Britain needs to stand united more than ever, it finds itself divided as portions of the parliament holds Chamberlain in contempt.\n\nLacking vital support from Labour, the Prime Minister has made the decision to resign, favoring Lord Halifax as his replacement. However, Halifax has been skeptical and Chamberlain has advised the King to call on Winston Churchill. Halifax has popular support, but Churchill's prewar remarks now seem prescient, and a bulldog like him may be what we need for the coming war."
 britain.9.a:0 "Churchill will see us through."
 britain.9.b:0 "Halifax is the more sensible option."
 
 britain.10.t:0 "Chamberlain Passes Away"
 britain.10.d:0 "Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain has fallen ill recently, despite previously generally having been healthy for his age. After being diagnosed with bowel cancer, increased pain and lost sleep has led him to resign from his post. Chamberlain still enjoys strong popular support and steps down only as a last resort, realizing he will not live to return to work.\n\nThe question remains who will take up the torch after this great statesman and lead Britain through the dark times that may still lie ahead of us."
 britain.10.a:0 "Churchill will see us through."
 britain.10.b:0 "Halifax is the more sensible option."

 britain.24.t:0 "Wallis Simpson"
 britain.24.d:0 "The new King-Emperor is a boyish and troublesome sort, prone to rudeness, defiance of tradition and worst of all, womanising. His latest affair is with a twice-divorced American socialite, Wallis Simpson - whom he declares his intent to marry.  This presents a potential constitutional crisis, as the Church of England, which the British monarch presides over, forbids remarriage after divorce, not to even mention Simpson's low birth.  Neither the British people nor those of our Dominions abroad will accept this American as queen - while we have managed to keep the media silent at home, the press runs wild abroad, and it will not be long before the British public catch wind of this scandal."
 britain.24.a:0 "This will have to get sorted out before the coronation"
 
 britain.25.t:0 "Abdication Crisis"
 britain.25.d:0 "As the coronation draws nearer, concern regarding the new King-Emperor's engagement to Wallis Simpson grows. The Dominion Prime Ministers have unanimously rejected her as a match for the British Sovereign, and the Baldwin government is threatening to collectively resign. The monarch now faces a simple choice - love, or duty?"
 britain.25.a:0 "What good is being a King if you can't marry the one you love?" 
 britain.25.b:0 "She will have to go for the good of the Empire"
 
 britain.26.t:0 "Coronation of Edward VIII"
 britain.26.d:0 "With the issue of Wallis Simpson long since cleared away, the coronation of the new British Sovereign has gone ahead smoothly. The monarch has been anointed, crowned, enthroned, and now reigns as Edward VIII, King of the United Kingdom and the British Dominions, and Emperor of India. The celebrations have been Empire-wide, with Indian and African Royalty attending the ceremonies in London along with Dominion leaders. From the mountains of the Yukon to the pleasant shores of Auckland, parades and festivities have been held. Coins bearing his unusually left-facing portrait have gone out across the Empire, along with stamps and other memorabilia. This has been the first coronation to take advantage of new technology, being filmed and broadcast on radio to the Empire's subjects, and the world."
 britain.26.a:0 "God save the King!" 
 
 britain.27.t:0 "Coronation of George VI"
 britain.27.d:0 "With the short and troubled reign of Edward VIII now behind the Empire, the rule of the previously little-known George VI has been ushered in with bombastic fashion. The monarch has been anointed, crowned, enthroned, and now reigns as George VI, King of the United Kingdom and the British Dominions, and Emperor of India. The celebrations have been Empire-wide, with Indian and African Royalty attending the ceremonies in London along with Dominion leaders. From the wastes of the Yukon to the pleasant shores of Auckland, parades and festivities have been held. Coins and stamps bearing the monarch's image have gone out across the Empire, along with other memorabilia. This has been the first coronation to take advantage of new technology, being filmed and broadcast on radio to the Empire's subjects, and the world."
 britain.27.a:0 "God save the King!" 
 
 britain.28.t:0 "Newfoundland Referendum"
 britain.28.d:0 "In an early step towards a new policy of colonial self-determination, the citizens of Newfoundland have gone to the polls to decide the future of their country, and have voted by only a slim majority to join Canada."
 britain.28.a:0 "O, Canada!"  
 
 britain.29.t:0 "The Battle of Cable Street"
 britain.29.d:0 "Oswald Mosley's growing blackshirt street movement, the British Union of Fascists have declared their intent to march through the heart of London's East End, in full uniform before it's large Jewish population. Fearing violence, the Home Secretary has sent a police escort to help the march continue - but local communists, socialists, anarchists, Jews and labour activists have not been detered, and promise Mosley a fight."
 britain.29.a:0 "The antifascists turn the marchers back." 
 britain.29.b:0 "The blackshirts break through and march through the East End." 
 britain.29.c:0 "The antifascists turn the tables on the blackshirts."

 britain.30.t:0 "The British Revolution"
 britain.30.d:0 "With London still recovering from the turmoil of last week's sudden and violent revolution, the Empire is still reeling. The unbelievable events in the British Metropole have left the extremities of our Empire, ideologically opposed to the new British government and constitutionally vexed, seeking to tread their own path."
 britain.30.a:0 "Traitors, the lot of them!" 
 
 britain.31.t:0 "North America goes its own way!"
 britain.31.d:0 "At some point before the storming of Buckingham Palace, the British Monarchy fled to Canada, which has now declared itself an independent constitutional monarchy and seized Newfoundland. In the Caribbean, a loose coalition of island states have formed up the West Indies Federation from our territories there."
 britain.31.a:0 "God help us..." 
 
 britain.32.t:0 "India goes its own way!"
 britain.32.d:0 "The conservative Anglo-Indian elite, now standing alone as the dominant minority in India, unable to accept the radical change in the regime of the metropole, have declared their independence from the Empire, with the smaller outposts in South Asia joining them willingly."
 britain.32.a:0 "God help us..." 
 
 britain.33.t:0 "The vultures pick over Africa"
 britain.33.d:0 "The Afrikaners of South Africa, never friends to the British, have declared their independence as a republic and seized Bechuanaland. To the north, the already quasi-independent Rhodesias have cast off the British shackles along with Nyasaland. Our colonies in West & East Africa have been seized by France & Italy, who will no doubt lead our territories to ruin."
 britain.33.a:0 "God help us..." 
 
 britain.34.t:0 "Oceania goes its own way!"
 britain.34.d:0 "Australia and New Zealand have proclaimed their independence as republics, and assumed control of our surrounding island colonies. While pledging they will return to the fold should 'civilised rule' ever be restored to Britain, it is looking unlikely."
 britain.34.a:0 "God help us..." 
 
 britain.35.t:0 "The vultures pick over the Near East"
 britain.35.d:0 "France has assumed control of all territories from the Suez Canal up to the border of their own Syria, while the Greeks of Cyprus have at last achieved their Enosis, and our remaining scattered territories did not last long before being snapped up by whichever backwater Sultanates held a grudge against our Empire."
 britain.35.a:0 "God help us..." 
 
 britain.36.t:0 "Britain proposes Syndicalisation"
 britain.36.d:0 "It is no secret the red tide of communism, socialism, and anarchism is on the rise in Ireland. Winning increasing seats in parliament and making themselves worryingly visible on the streets of Dublin, it seems only a matter of time until we are swamped by them. No doubt responsible for at least some of this, across the Irish Sea the British Federation has given us a tantalising offer. A United Irish Syndicate, on the same standing with Wales & Scotland. While this may seem to be vassalisation under any other name, the acquisition of the Six Counties is a long-coveted prize..."
 britain.36.a:0 "It seems this would be our best move" 
 britain.36.b:0 "Outrageous! Absolutely not"

 britain.38.t:0 "Anthrax attack averted!"
 britain.38.d:0 "A dastardly British plan, intent on poisoning German cattle with anthrax, thus disseminating the plague to the rest of the German population, has thankfully been thwarted by our Abwehr agents. A number of disguised British special agents were detained near Greifswald, and after interrogation revealed the nature of their mission. Such barbarity in what we have been waging as a civilised war is almost unthinkable. Truly, the British can never be trusted."
 britain.38.a:0 "How could they even conceive of something like this?"
 
 britain.39.t:0 "Devastating Anthrax attack!"
 britain.39.d:0 "The unthinkable has befallen us. Agents of a hostile foreign government, Britain it would seem, have managed to infect massive quantities of German cattle with anthrax spores, which have begun to spread ceaselessly to the civilian population. Our attempts to contain the outbreak are ongoing, but the ramifications are immediate. Bodies line the streets, entire towns lie empty, with massive groups of refugees fleeing from the country to the cities in hope of safety, only exacerbating the food crisis brought on by the extermination of such large numbers of cattle. The army is in disarray. Our top scientists predict many of the infected areas will not be able to be inhabitable again for several decades. The Fuhrer has pledged retaliation, but in the state we are in, it seems doubtful that we will be able to."
 britain.39.a:0 "There are no words..."
 
 britain.40.t:0 "Failure of Operation Vegetarian"
 britain.40.d:0 "Despite our best efforts, our attempts at executing Operation Vegetarian have failed. With our on the ground personnel MIA and presumed in captivity, there is no doubt their air defences will be on high alert, preventing airborne shipments of the infected material being distributed. It won't be long before this comes out to the Intelligence communities of our fellow allied nations, and to the world - it is doubtful they will understand the direness of our situation."
 britain.40.a:0 "Drat."
 
 britain.41.t:0 "Operation Vegetarian succeeds!"
 britain.41.d:0 "Against all odds, the plan has worked! Anthrax-infected linseed cakes having been distributed to of German cattle, the poisoned meat has gone out to the German population, who have already begun dying in droves. It seems we have 'succeeded', but... the scenes we see now in Germany have lead many wonder to if this was the right course to take. Large numbers of the British population are themselves horrified by this choice, and we find ourselves condemned by our fellow Allied leaders. This may be a bridge too far."   
 britain.41.a:0 "May God forgive us."
 
 britain.42.t:0 "Assassination attempt averted"
 britain.42.d:0 "Men of the Führerbegleitkommando today apprehended two British agents and arrested a local collaborator near the Berghof, Hitler's personal residency in the Bavarian Alps. They are currently being subjected to questioning, but this would appear to be an attempted assassination! In response, vigilance has been raised and the SS, Abwehr, Gestapo and other security apparatus of the state are on high alert."
 britain.42.a:0 "That was close..."
 
 britain.43.t:0 "The Fuhrer is dead"
 britain.43.d:0 "Today, suddenly, while Adolf Hitler was talking his morning walk at the Berghof residence in the Bavarian Alps, he was shot and immediately struck dead by a sniper. Two British agents were soon after apprehended, with one being killed on the spot and the other taken into custody. All nearby towns have been put under lockdown, and a massive investigation has come underway to find every single traitor responsible for this. In accordance with the Fuhrer's will, Hermann Goering has stepped up as new Fuhrer of the German Reich. We are still preparing on how to best break this news to the German public."
 britain.43.a:0 "Without him, we may truly be lost."
 
 britain.44.t:0 "British Anthrax attack on Germany"
 britain.44.d:0 "The British, abandoning all codes and norms of civilised society and warfare, have done the unthinkable. Using anthrax-infected linseed cakes distributed to German cattle, they have wrought chemical warfare on a scale never seen before on this planet - as of yet, possible millions of Germans lie dead, soldiers and civilians alike. Britain's allies and enemies alike have condemned this senseless act of brutality. While the Fuhrer has issued vows of retaliation, his personal status and that of many other high-ranking Nazi officials remains unclear."
 britain.44.a:0 "How could they even think of such a thing?"
 
 britain.45.t:0 "Operation Foxley failure"
 britain.45.d:0 "Not even managing to lay eyes on Hitler, and apparently given away by a relative of the German villager aiding them, our two men sent in to Bavaria with the aim of killing the Fuhrer have been captured. German press releases show they have caught on to their mission and hightened security around Hitler - any such further assaults on the Fuhrer's person are now out of the question."
 britain.45.a:0 "It was always a long shot."
 
 britain.46.t:0 "Hitler assassinated!"
 britain.46.d:0 "A few days ago, suddenly, while Adolf Hitler was talking his morning walk at the Berghof residence in the Bavarian Alps, he was shot and immediately struck dead by a sniper. Two British agents were soon after apprehended, with one being killed on the spot and the other taken into custody. A massive investigation between all arms of the German state have descended on Bavaria, intent on rooting out any even remotely connected with the murder of their Fuhrer. Hermann Goering has been appointed the new Fuhrer in accordance with Hitler's will, and vows the war will continue."
 britain.46.a:0 "Unbelievable!"

This breach of the 1921 Treaty lead to a breakdown in relations, and subsequent trade restrictions from both countries.

 britain.76.d:0 "The irregular Imperial Conference, last held in 1932, has been adjourned in London today. Provoked primarily by unfolding events on the continent, key issues were Foreign Affairs & Defence, leading to a debate on Dominion Foreign Policy in relation to that of the British Government, given New Zealand's strong feelings regarding the Italian Invasion of Abyssinia. One final, and rather major matters is that of the Imperial Federation - talk of the neccessity to federalise the Empire to counter the growing independence of the Dominions and the allegedly inevitable collapse of the Empire as a world power due to the growing power of the Soviet Union & United States has been going around in many circles since the turn of the century, but now it has achieved official attention."
