    welcome.3.d:0 "Welcome my friend, how is your day going! You have chosen the 1918 scenario, the war has now gone on for four long years, but not all is bad for the Central Powers whom have knocked out Russia, this means they can focus all of their eastern divisions on the western front giving them numerical superiority. This has prompted Erich Ludendorff to plan the 'Kaiserschlacht' otherwise known as the Kaiser's Battle or Spring Offensive. But on the inside the Central Powers are slowly falling apart, desertion, war exhaustion, and the blockade is all taking its toll and they will either win quick or lose quick. \n\n If you find any bugs make sure to report them in the bugs discussion, thanks in advance helps everyone out. \n\n Credits: Lev Slav and MisterJay and Knifepony"

    welcome.41.d:0 "Hello and welcome to the new Endsieg scenario. This is the first new scenario done by MisterJay, and will be expanded upon greatly. This scenario is best played in duos, with both a Soviet Union and a Germany! If you are playing this solo, I suggest playing this on hard mode. Good luck and make the Führer proud!"

    welcome.4.t:0 "Welcome to the Mod (1943)"
    welcome.4.d:0 "Welcome my friend, how is your day going! You have chosen the 1943 scenario, currently Germany has gathered its forces for its (historically) last major offensive on the eastern front at the Kursk Salient, however the Soviets who have learned of this Operation (Citadel) in advance have made efforts to entrench themselves heavily. In Italy, the allies have landed taking most of sicily and the Italians are on the fence between the Allies and the Axis. Japan has reached its zenith in Asia with the U.S. starting to push down hard against them, however they are relatively successful in China. \n\n If you find any bugs make sure to report them in the bugs discussion, thanks in advance helps everyone out. \n\n Credits: Lev Slav, MisterJay and Matteo Bosso for the new OOB's"

    welcome.5.d:0 "Welcome my friend, how is your day going! You have chosen the June 20th, 1944 scenario, currently Germany is under attack from the east and the west. In the west the allies have landed in Normandy bringing in more troops by the day, in the east the Soviets have launched Operation Bagration pushing hard against the Germans in Belarus. In Asia Japan is falling back with the U.S. making signficant success island hopping towards the Japanese mainland and liberating allied territory with Japan still having a strong hold on China. Indeed this is the fate of the gods (Götterdämmerung). \n\n If you find any bugs make sure to report them in the bugs discussion, thanks in advance, helps everyone. \n\n Credits: Lev Slav MisterJay and Matteo Bosso for the new OOB's"

    welcome.6.d:0 "Welcome my friend, how is your day going! You have chosen the December 16, 1944 scenario, on the Western Front German troops under the cover of a fog (which is thankfully put the Allied Airforce out of action) have started their one last gamble starting a major (surprise) counter offensive with hopes to cut off the Allies by taking Antwerp and destroying four of the allied Armies. In the east the Red Army has just barely entered Germany, \"liberating\" Romania, Bulgaria, and a chunk of Yugoslavia pushing into Hungary, the time has now come, the final fight for the Fatherland. Is it to late for Germany? In Asia the Americans have just recently landed in the Phillipines and the Japanese navy has been practically wiped out with a few remenants remaining, the hold on China is still strong. \n\n If you find any bugs make sure to report them in the bugs discussion, thanks in advance, helps everyone. \n\n Credits: Lev Slav MisterJay and Matteo Bosso for the new OOB's"

    welcome.7.d:0 "Welcome my friend, how is your day going! You have daringly (if you play as Germany, what are you going to play the Soviet Union? Seriously if you do...just why?) chosen the 1945 scenario. On both fronts the Germans have been heavily pushed back but Goebbels calls for the Endsieg continue and the Fuhrer none-the-less continues to be filled with hope for a chance at turning the war around. In Asia, the Americans are now fighting a winning battle at Iwo Jima, right next to mainland Japan, which has now been bombed to bits. \n\n If you find any bugs make sure to report it in the bugs discussion so I can fix it, thanks in advance. \n\n Credits: Lev Slav MisterJay and Matteo Bosso for the new OOB's"

    welcome.8.t:0 "Welcome to the Mod (1948)"
    welcome.8.d:0 "Welcome my friend, how is your day going! You have chosen the 1948, alternate history scenario where Germany has to an extent won the Second World War. Following the decisive German victory at Moscow and then Stalingrad, Germany and the Soviet Union reluctantly agreed to a treaty. In Italy the Allies pushed for a major invasion prompting the Italian King, Vittorio Emanuel to switch sides with the Allies initial success, as a result the Germans quickly beat back the Italian troops occupying Montenegro, Albania, and Greece setting up their own client states before setting up a loyal Italian Social Republic headed by Benito Mussolini and defeating the allied invasion. With no side able to break the dead lock in the next years an armistice, with no treaty, was agreed upon in 1945, a peace without victory. Japan was not included, and thus was defeated that same year. Britain remains in a war economy, ready for any attack, and the allies are seemingly plotting for another major invasion perhaps with the peace being unstable. \n\n If you find any bugs make sure to report them in the bugs discussion, thanks in advance, helps everyone. \n\n Credits: Lev Slav and MisterJay"

 ### MODERN DAY DOCTRINES
 
 #Land Doctrines
 TITLE_LEGACY_DOCTRINES:0 "Legacy Doctrines"
 LEGACY_DOCTRINES_TITLE:0 "Legacy Doctrines are Cold War-era doctrines that still have a noticeable influence on modern military thought."
 legacy_doctrines_MD:0 "Legacy Doctrines"
 legacy_doctrines_MD_desc:0 "Legacy Doctrines are Cold War-era doctrines that still have a noticeable influence on modern military thought. Though doctrines change over time, the past is still deeply embeded in any armed force."
 modern_blitzkrieg_MD:0 "Modern Blitzkrieg"
 modern_blitzkrieg_MD_desc:0 "Incredibly successful in the opening stages of World War 2, Germany's Blitzkrieg Doctrine was widely copied by others, becoming a mainstay of Cold War strategic thought - especially in NATO circles. It aims to concentrate mobile forces, using them to continuously maneuver into enemy territory whilst avoiding enemy strong points."
 forward_defense_MD:0 "Forward Defense"
 forward_defense_MD_desc:0 "NATO strategists, in countering the threat of Soviet armor overrunning Western Europe, came up with the doctrine of Forward Defense. Pre-planned defensive forces armed with anti-tank and anti-air weapons would starve off the initial push while reserves would be mobilized behind them. The idea was that the initial titanic-sized battles would determine the outcome of the war, and thus the majority of active forces should be placed as close to the front as possible."
 encourage_nco_iniative_MD:0 "Encourage NCO Initiative"
 encourage_nco_iniative_MD_desc:0 "Western military thought encouraged initiative among non-commissioned officers (lower-level command), viewing them as the backbone of their armies. With rapidly changing situations, avoiding having to go through the entire chain of command allows an NCO to exploit opportunities on the battlefield that would otherwise be missed."
 air_land_battle_MD:0 "AirLand Battle"
 air_land_battle_MD_desc:0 "AirLand Battle emphasized close coordination between land forces acting as an aggressively maneuvering defense, with air forces attacking rear-echelon forces feeding the enemy front line, taking pressure off the enemy’s main advance. The aim is to delay the enemy, creating a window of opportunity to defeat front line forces while delivering severe attrition to their rear."
 grand_battleplan_MD:0 "Grand Battleplan"
 grand_battleplan_MD_desc:0 "The Grand Battleplan doctrine favors the pre-planning of each stage of combat extensively, holding the view that the side with the best planning would prevail. When done correctly, it can be very powerful, as troops can concentrate on perfecting their aspect of the plan, while allowing combined operations in forces incapable of real-time coordination. While good planning avoids logistical problems, it is slow work, redicing initiative and having no real flexibility in the face of a fluid front line."
 rigid_hierarchy_MD:0 "Rigid Hierarchy"
 rigid_hierarchy_MD_desc:0 "With the legitimate fear that one’s own army poses the greatest threat to regime survival, commanding positions would often be done out of political loyality instead of competance. Large, live-fire excersises would generally not be held. Furthermore, desicion-making would be centralized, making it slow and inflexible in the face of evolving threats."
 praetorian_guard_MD:0 "Praetorian Guard"
 praetorian_guard_MD_desc:0 "With the political leadership focusing the army on regime protection, elite seperate units were set up that employed professional soldiers with ideological selection and training. These would recieve the best weapons and training, making them well-placed to defend the political leadership from uprisings and the threat of coups by the normal conscripted army."
 armoured_mass_assault_MD:0 "Mass Armoured Assault"
 armoured_mass_assault_MD_desc:0 "Mass Armoured Assault, under the Soviet concept of "Deep Battle" stressed combined arms cooperation, offensive action, and heavily armored shock units. Multiple attacks would be made on a single front by slower, firepower-heavy units in order to break the enemy tactical zone. At the same time, highly mobile armored and mechanized forces would be held in reserve, advancing into the front once gaps are created. This is distinct from Blitzkreig, which focuses on single weak-points instead of multiple points of contact."
 deep_echelon_advance_MD:0 "Deep Echelon Advance"
 deep_echelon_advance_MD_desc:0 "With gaps in enemy lines sucessfully created, several advances of heavily armored shock troops would ravage the enemy rear at a high speed while avoiding strong points of enemy resistance - leaving them to follow the advances of less heavy infantry forces. The goal is to sieze enemy territory at an breakneck speed, creating the conditions whereby the enemy loses the will to mount an operational defence."

Following the Fall of France, we had hoped the English would seek an armistice, but seeing as they declined we will have to resort to more definitive measures. To dare this operation, we would need an immense amount of vessels and air support."
 GER_fall_grun:0 "Fall Grün"

We can recreate our initial victory against the French through the Ardennes, and they should have no time to respond. We should be able to encircle huge amounts of divisions, which will free up our men to defend in the east."

 GER_operation_typhoon_desc:0 "Our plans to attack the Soviet capital can finally be put to use. Our attack will consist of two pincer offensives, one from the north of Moscow against the Kalinin Front, and the other to the south of Moscow Oblast against the Western Front. This operation will have a huge part in determining the outcome of this war."

We still control large portions of the Soviet union, enough to fight a staggered retreat across the front to wear down the Soviets, but before we can begin defensive operations we must make one more offensive to stabalize the frontline."
 GER_fall_blau_desc:0 "We failed to capture our objectives of the last year, however we have not yet lost the innitiative on the Eastern front. The majority of the Soviet forces are situated in and around Moscow and along our central front. We have the option to strike south and capture the vital baku oil fields, along with the City of Stalins name, which would be a striking blow to the Bolsheviks."

# Industrialisation #
 industrialisation.1.t:0 "Traditionalists Argue Against Industrialisation"
 industrialisation.1.d:0 "Traditionalists in the government have argued against our move towards a industrial society arguing that we have lived for hundreds of years on an agrarian based economy and that there is no need to move towards an industrial society now. \n\n None-the-less the reform will be going through but the traditionalists will keep the government somewhat divided for the time being..."
 industrialisation.1.a:0 "Oh well"
 industrialisation.2.t:0 "Unrest Amongst the Workers"
 industrialisation.2.d:0 "With Industrialisation in our country moving forward ever so slowly it has not come without its troubles as many factory owners have started instead of searching for skilled workers, taken the unskilled workers for cheaper labor. Due to this there has been growing unrest in the new working class, whilst not quite serious yet the bubble will burst eventually..."
 industrialisation.2.a:0 "We are good for now!"
 industrialisation.3.t:0 "Pre-Industrial Society"
 industrialisation.3.d:0 "We are now considered by the world to be a Pre-Industrial Society and have effectively moved away from being the Agrarian Society we once were. Of course our path to this stage has not come without its troubles but the path ahead of us is still long and windy."
 industrialisation.3.a:0 "One Hurrah for Industrialisation!"
 industrialisation.4.t:0 "Railway Construction"
 industrialisation.4.d:0 "In order to increase the efficiency of goods being transported across the country our government has taken the initiative to start construction of a major railway, this alone should employ many workers however the costs will be quite high though worth it in the end if we plan to move further."
 industrialisation.4.a:0 "Start working!"
 industrialisation.5.t:0 "People's Mentality"
 industrialisation.5.d:0 "Despite our efforts to start industrialisation reforms many of our people still have a backwards mentality toward industrialisation. Many of our rich capitalists still prefer to invest in land rather than buisnesses, they see investments in industry risky making land purchases much more appealing."
 industrialisation.5.a:0 "This is a bad mentality for the long run!"
 industrialisation.6.t:0 "Early Industrial Society"
 industrialisation.6.d:0 "We are now considered by the world to be an Early Industrial Society, effectively moving away from our former status as a Pre-Industrial Society. Now we can be considered to be  more like some of the European nations that have progressed somewhat significantly in terms of industry."
 industrialisation.6.a:0 "Two Hurrahs for Industrialisation!"
 industrialisation.7.t:0 "Major Workers Strike"
 industrialisation.7.d:0 "Issues from the past with unskilled workers being employed for cheap wages over the skilled have not been forgotten. A major workers strike has been held in one of our major industrial areas where workers have been protesting for higher wages and less work hours which have put a strain on our production output, if this isn't resolved quick it will turn into a problem."
 industrialisation.7.a:0 "Give them what they want..."
 industrialisation.8.t:0 "Protests from Traditionalists"
 industrialisation.8.d:0 "As we start to move forward even further the traditionalists have not gone away by any means, there is still a large struggle not only with some backwards politcians but the people themselves that have the same tradtionalist mentaility refusing change!"
 industrialisation.8.a:0 "Darn"
 industrialisation.9.t:0 "Population Through the Years"
 industrialisation.9.d:0 "Due to the fact that our nation does not have enough land suited for farming required to feed our growing population is making things quite difficult, many say that if we continue going forward we will have to continually rely on other nations for food products."
 industrialisation.9.a:0 "They have a point..."
 industrialisation.10.t:0 "Basic Industrial Society"
 industrialisation.10.d:0 "We are now considered by the world to be a Basic Industrial Society, like most European nations, we are just below the major countries."
 industrialisation.10.a:0 "Three Hurrahs for Industrialisation!"
 industrialisation.11.t:0 "Workers Strike Spirals Out of Control!"
 industrialisation.11.d:0 "Workers in our most industrialised region have started a strike for higher wages, less work hours, better working conditions, and universal suffrage. Whilst the strike started off small it quickly grew in size to thousands of people protesting, the local government in turn sent out an army unit to keep control of the protest where it quickly turned into a blood bath as shots were fired onto the crowd."
 industrialisation.11.a:0 "Not good..."
 industrialisation.12.t:0 "Resources Issue"
 industrialisation.12.d:0 "As we push even further in terms of industrialisation it is getting rather difficult as much of the resources required do not currently have or produce enough of which means our progress will be significantly slowed down for now."
 industrialisation.12.a:0 "Darn"
 industrialisation.13.t:0 "New Rising Social Class"
 industrialisation.13.d:0 "With our industrial growth promoting large immigration towards our cities/industrial centers we have found ourselves unequipped to handle this large urban population growth where not enough residences can be constructed in time to house enough people. Many are forced to live together in horrible conditions and then go to work in such conditions giving birth to a new social class that may be very well susceptible to revolutionary ideas...."
 industrialisation.13.a:0 "Frightening"
 industrialisation.14.t:0 "Industrial Society"
 industrialisation.14.d:0 "We have reached the top of the ladder and are now considered to officialy be an Industrial Society, we are now largely ahead of most countries in the world."
 industrialisation.14.a:0 "Four Hurrahs for Industrialisation!"

# WW1 Britain #
 ww1_britain.1.t:0 "Anti-German Sentiment"
 ww1_britain.1.d:0 "Ever since the death of Queen Victoria and Kaiser Wilhelm II's imperialistic and naval ambitions which threaten our nation there has been a great schism between Germany and the United Kingdom."
 ww1_britain.1.a:0 "Those Huns won't get ahead of us!"
 ww1_britain.2.t:0 "Preparation for War"
 ww1_britain.2.d:0 "The fuse leading to the Powder Keg has been lit, it is only a matter of time before the war breaks out for which we must prepare for the better or the worst of what it may turn into."
 ww1_britain.2.a:0 "Alright"
 ww1_britain.3.t:0 "British Neutrality"
 ww1_britain.3.d:0 "Although we have heavily aligned ourselves with the Entente we have declared neutrality in this conflict for the time being, whilst it doesnt mean we will remain neutral for the whole of the war, we will for now keep a watchful eye on how the war goes and may enter later."
 ww1_britain.3.a:0 "We will keep a safe distance for now..."
 ww1_britain.4.t:0 "Backing of France!"
 ww1_britain.4.d:0 "With the Germans violating Beglian Neutrality and going against any sort of British Interests we have taken neccesary steps to join the Entente in the war against them."
 ww1_britain.4.a:0 "We won't let our allies down!"
 ww1_britain.5.t:0 "Britain Declares War on Central Powers"
 ww1_britain.5.d:0 "Whilst we have previously proclaimed temporary neutrality, we have spectated the war and have now taken actions to get involved ourselves on the side of the Entente whom ultimately protects British interests."
 ww1_britain.5.a:0 "We will not accept German hegemony over Europe!"
 ww1_britain.6.t:0 "North Sea Blockade"
 ww1_britain.6.d:0 "In an effort to restrict the maritime supply of goods to the Central Powers, we have taken actions to blockade any convoys heading to Germany or any other Central Powers members. The German Empire heaily relies on imports to feed their population and supply their war industry, thus this should have a serious affect on their internal stability and war efficiency."
 ww1_britain.6.a:0 "Good"
 ww1_britain.7.t:0 "Conscription in Ireland Begins"
 ww1_britain.7.d:0 "Whilst our attempts to conscript the Irish populous have been met with serious protest and we have been on shakey terms following the Easter Rising, it is none the less neccesary as we are in dire need of more manpower to fill the ranks."
 ww1_britain.7.a:0 "A neccesary action"
 ww1_britain.8.t:0 "Irish Conscription Crisis"
 ww1_britain.8.d:0 "Calls for conscription in Ireland have been met with serious protest and opposition and thus we have decided to not go through with instating conscription in Ireland. Whilst it may deprive us of neccesary manpower it will be none-the-less more worthwhile and keep the nation more stable in a time where stability is neccesary to avoid revolution."
 ww1_britain.8.a:0 "Dissent is the last thing we need"
 ww1_britain.9.t:0 "Call for Scandinavia to Break with Germany"
 ww1_britain.9.d:0 "Like the United States has decided to break with Germany we have asked the Scandinavian monarchs, Haakon VII of Norway, Gustav V of Sweden, and Christian X of Denmark, to consider breaking with Germany. Whilst the North Sea Blockade is effective, it will never be 100% efficient if the Scandinavian nations continue to trade with Germany."
 ww1_britain.9.a:0 "Hopefully they will follow Americas lead"
 ww1_britain.901.t:0 "Scandinavia Refuses to Break with Germany"
 ww1_britain.901.d:0 "The Scandinavian monarchs have recently held a conference in Copenhagen and have ultimately declined to break off diplomatic and trade relations with Germany because of the 'ruthless' submarine warfare."
 ww1_britain.901.a:0 "Damn!"
 ww1_britain.902.t:0 "Scandinavia Agrees to Break with Germany"
 ww1_britain.902.d:0 "The Scandinavian monarchs have recently held a conference in COpenhagen and have ultimately agreed to break off diplomatic and trade relations with Germany because of the ruthless submarine warfare."
 ww1_britain.902.a:0 "Great"
 ww1_britain.10.t:0 "Our Friends Portugal"
 ww1_britain.10.d:0 "The Portuguese have long since remained close with us, it is well known that the Portuguese and Germany are not on good terms with some serious tension between the two when it comes to submarine warfare."
 ww1_britain.10.a:0 "Ok"
 ww1_britain.11.t:0 "Portugal Joins Entente"
 ww1_britain.11.d:0 "With the Portuguese and Germany facing serious tension due to Germany's decision to enact unrestricted submarine warfare, which has as a result sank many Portuguese ships, the Portuguese have ultimately decided to join the Entente."
 ww1_britain.11.a:0 "Great"
 ww1_britain.12.t:0 "Negotiations with Bulgaria"
 ww1_britain.12.d:0 "Bulgaria is key to success in the Balkans, should the Central Powers get Bulgaria to join them our ally Serbia will likely fall and thus Germany will be able to directly send supplies to Turkey. However, should Bulgaria join us Turkey's capital Constantinople will be severely threatened and Serbia's position furthermore reinforced. The thing is, we have unlike the Central Powers, little to offer to Bulgaria. However, we have urged Serbia to cede some of its territory to Bulgaria in hopes of getting Bulgaria to join us. However, it is not as much as the Central Powers are offering, the Bulgarians will likely not consider our offer but there is still a chance they will."
 ww1_britain.12.a:0 "Lets hope they will consider it"
 ww1_britain.1201.t:0 "Britain Offers us Deal"
 ww1_britain.1201.d:0 "The British have attempted to sway us to their side, they have offered some of our claims in Serbia and Edirne from the Ottoman Turks. Although it isn't as much as the Central Powers are willing to offer, would it be likely that Germany will win this war given their inability to control the seas?"
 ww1_britain.1201.a:0 "Accept British Deal"
 ww1_britain.1201.b:0 "We are not interested"
 ww1_britain.1202.t:0 "Bulgaria Accepts Our Offer"
 ww1_britain.1202.d:0 "The Bulgarians have thankfully accepted our generous offer of territorial gains, although it isn't as much as what the Central Powers were likely offering it seems they have come to their senses that we will ultimately win this war in the end."
 ww1_britain.1202.a:0 "Great!"
 ww1_britain.1203.t:0 "Bulgaria Rejects Our Offer"
 ww1_britain.1203.d:0 "As we have predicted, the Bulgarians have unfortunately rejected our offer of territorial gains, it is very much likely due to the fact that the Central Powers have promised far more than we could offer. As unfortunate as it is that we could not sway Bulgaria to our side we will ultimately win this war, with them or not."
 ww1_britain.1203.a:0 "Quite unfortunate indeed"
 ww1_britain.13.t:0 "Bulgaria Joins Entente"
 ww1_britain.13.d:0 "The Bulgarians have finally finished preparing to join the conflict and have officially declared their entrance into the Entente. With their help we will keep Turkey and Germany divided and threaten Constantinople as well as reinforcing Serbia's position for good."
 ww1_britain.13.a:0 "Great!"
 ww1_britain.14.t:0 "Our Friends America"
 ww1_britain.14.d:0 "Whilst the United States has declared neutrality in the European conflict they ultimately favor us far more than the Central Powers given our democratic status."
 ww1_britain.14.a:0 "Hopefully we can get them to join"
 ww1_britain.15.t:0 "USA Joins Entente"
 ww1_britain.15.d:0 "The United States has long since been aiding the Entente throughout the war and it ultimately any sort of neutrality they have declared has withered away over time and they have ultimately decided to join the European conflict formally."
 ww1_britain.15.a:0 "The tide has turned"
 ww1_britain.16.t:0 "Fortification of the Suez Canal"
 ww1_britain.16.d:0 "The Suez Canal is a critical strategic point, and thus we have taken neccesary actions to fortify the canal in case of a future war."
 ww1_britain.16.a:0 "It is of strategic importance"
 ww1_britain.17.t:0 "Securing Southern Persia"

 ww1_britain.17.a:0 "Good"
 ww1_britain.18.t:0 "Turkish Ships Incorporated into Royal Navy"
 ww1_britain.18.d:0 "The Turkish Ships 'Osmân-ı Evvel' and 'Reşadiye' have been incporated into the Royal Navy on the orders of Winston Churchill who does not want to risk the ships being used against us. However, given the fact that the pay for the ships was funded by public subscriptions partially, by taverns, cafes, schools, and market, this action has caused considerable ill will in the Ottoman Empire. The seizure of the ships has influenced the Ottoman public opinion of us in a seriously negative way."
 ww1_britain.18.a:0 "Damn"
 ww1_britain.19.t:0 "Arab Revolt"
 ww1_britain.19.d:0 "Hussein bin Ali, the Sharif of Mecca, has initiated the Arab Rebellion with the aim of securing independence from the ruling Ottoman Turks in hopes of creating a single unified Arab State. The Sharif claims that the Young Turks have violated the sacred tenets of Islam and has called upon Arab Muslims to the sacred Rebellion against the ostensibly 'impious' Ottoman Government. \n\n Whilst the revolt is being assisted by our government it is none-the-less not as popular as we could have hoped it would become with the majority of Arabs still staying loyal to the Ottoman Empire."

 ww1_britain.25.d:0 "A daring plan has been proposed by the British Admiralty to land troops on the Gallipoli Peninsula and from there to head up and to hopefully eventually seize the capital of the Ottoman Empire, Constantinople which means a great deal to the Turks.

May circles on the edge of the fight until he sights Richtofen's cousin Wolfram crossing his front, Richtofen sees his cousin under fire and closes in, opens fire. The inexperienced May, falls out of control probably saving his life. Richtofen breaks his own rule and follows him down as May plunges earthward but he regains control just over the Somme and follows the river West - and to the safety of his own lines. May's friend Roy Brown sees the pursuit and dives to help, a low level chase follows. With a strong easterly win, Richtofen is pushed further and further over enemy lines... alone... and under constant ground fire. Richtofen seems to become target fixated, unaware of Brown diving behind him; at this exact time Cedric Popkin, of the 24th Australian Machine Gun Company fires at the Red Triplane along with soldiers from the 53rd Battery, Royal Australian Artillery. As Brown fires a burst the Triplane rears up to the right, at 1200 hours near Vaux-sur-Somme, Richtofen receives a single, fatal, bullet wound to the chest. The Red Triplane Fokker falls vertically but pulls up at the last moment, most likely still under the control of Richtofen, but by the time the aircraft stops... Richtofen is dead. To this day nobody who knows who killed the Red Baron as the Sopwith and the ground fire both used the Vickers .303. However May, Mellersh, and LeBoutillier all claim to have seen the Triplane rear up as Roy Brown fired, though the shot that enetered the under right of his armpit exiting under his left nipple gave high credence to groundfire bringing him down."

The coup had been sanctioned and agreed upon by the German Empire itself which was dissatisfied by the inefficiency of the Republican government to deliver the promised and much needed grain supplies to the starving German Army. Skoropadsky that same day was Christ mated by the church and became the Hetman of Ukraine.

The first is Pyotr Krasnov, an autonomist leader of the Don Cossacks and former commander in chief of the Kerensky Republican Provisional Government of 1917. Krasnov is ready to ally with Ukraine and the new independent states from the former Russian Empire to fight the Bolsheviks. His priority is to attack Tsaritsyn and connect with the Eastern Whites before attacking Moscow with them.\n\n The second option was supported by Anton Denikin, leader of the Russian Volunteers. Denikin refuses to give up control of the Russian Empire territories and is not ready to recognize and ally with Ukraine and other neighboring countries from the former Tsars' Empire. Denikin's priority is to free the Kuban and North- Caucasus from the Bolsheviks before attacking Moscow from the South through the Ukraine. \N\N If you choose the Krasnov strategy and he succeeds in conquering the key town of Tsaritsyn this big victory will make him the leader of the Western Whites and, as the Don Cossack autonomist he would then ally with the Ukranian Nationalists instead of fighting them.

It determined the final southern border between the Republic of Austria and the newly formed Yugoslavia following WWI. The Carinthian area was disputed between both German-Austria and Yugoslavia but on November 5th, Yugoslav forces moved into the area which led to an amounting demand for a plebiscite for a region with a mixed population. The occupation of southeastern Carinthia by Yugoslav troops led to armed clashes. Before the plebiscite both sides waged intensive propaganda campaigns in which both promised a brotherhood particularly Austria. The results however were 59.1% in favor of adhesion to Austria and 40.9% in favor of annexation by Yugoslavia. Since the Austrian option gained a majority of votes in Slovene Zone A, the second stage of referendum in the Northern Zone B was not carried out and another Yugoslav foray was fiercely rejected by the Entente Powers."

The treaty declared the Austro-Hungarian Empire had to be dissolved and the Austrian side accept responsibility for causing the war with the rest of the Central Powers. It included large sums of war money or war reparations to the allies and prevented Austria from refraining or directly/indirectly compromising its independence meaning it could not enter into a political or economic union with the German Reich without agreement from the LoN. The new republic's initial self-chosen name German-Austria had to be changed to Austria, concription was abolished, and the Austrian Army was limited to 30,000 volunteers. \n\n The vast reduction of population, territory, and resources, wreaked havoc on the economy and Vienna the former imperial capital was now left with no empire to administrate or support it. The countries very unity was called into question and unlike Hungary, Austria never had been a nation in the true sense of word even though it existed for 700 years, it had no unifying force other than loyalty to the Hapsburgs which were now deposed for good."

 hungary.7.d:0 "On March 26th 1921, during the Holy Saturday that year the dit (Parlamentum Publicum) was not in session and the diplomatic corps was away at the time in the country. The regent of Hungary, Horthy had planned a quiet holiday with his family in the royal palace. Charles had been informed by his Swiss entourage whom told the former emperor of promises from European royalist circles and prompted Charles to take advantage of ‘this quiet’ against the warnings of his many supporters and Horthy himself whom said the time was not right to return to the throne. This did not change his stance as he was optimistic. His secret negotiations with Aristide Briand the French Prime Minister promised French Support if he was to succeed and no armed intervention from Hungary’s neighbors the ‘Little Entente’ whom were very willing to all invade Hungary if a Habsburg came back to power. Charles left his Swiss villa arriving undetected at Szombathely on the 26th of March where he made his way to the palace of Count Janos Mikes a prominent legitimist, from there the news spread like wildfire amongst local legitimist and by the 27th of March Charles had already acquired a small privy council including Horthy’s Minister of Education. After Charles met with the Prime Minister, Pal Teleki, he replied to Charles saying “too soon, too soon” before Charles and urged him to return back to Switzerland saying a civil war would break out with an intervention of the Little Entente. Charles made a final agreement to meet with Horthy and once he arrived at the palace, he was completely unannounced just as Horthy was sitting down to an Easter dinner with his wife. After Horthy finished his soup he led Charles to the Regent’s Office and had a two hour ‘emotional’ discussion with Charles which Horthy described as “the most difficult moments in my entire life”. Charles thanked Horthy for his service as regent but said the time came to “hand over the power to me” with Horthy replying “This is a disaster. In the name of God, Your Majesty must leave at once and return to Switzerland, before it’s too late and the powers learn of your presence in Budapest”. Charles frustrated said he “burned his bridges” speaking in German he continuously argued with Horthy and reminded him of his tearful pledge of loyalty made at the Schonbrunn Palace in November 1918 and the sworn oath of obedience to him from which he was never released. Horthy retaliated he sworn an oath to Hungary and Charles shocked said he would stick by his position and gave Horthy 5 minutes to think over it. Horthy was skeptical of Charles’s claims of assurance from PM Briand and reiterated his fear of civil war. Horthy expected Charles to leave Hungary and either march on Vienna or retire to Switzerland."

By April 3rd, the French PM Briant denied any deal being made which severely weakened Charles’ position. With the army still loyal to Horthy, Charles reluctantly left by train on the 5th of April reaching Hertenstein Palace that day. He still proclaimed himself to be the rightful Hungarian ruler two days later which showed up on the newspaper and the Swiss government placed stricter limits on his political activity. Charles left Hungary with a great dislike toward Horthy believing that the Great powers would not oppose restoration and that he was holding the power for his own personal reasons. He thought the Hungarian people yearned for his return, though no demonstrations of support occurred in Hungary during the Easter Crisis except minor scale demonstrations in traditionally royalist counties. People had generally treated him with indifference and Teleki resigned on the 6th of April with his poor handling of affairs."

 hungary.9.d:0 "On October 23rd 1921 a Treaty of Versailles-mandated plebiscite was scheduled to occur in Burgenland, due to this Count Gyula Ostenburg-Moravek and Colonel Lehar as well as other legitimist officers decided to take advantage of the tense situation sending Charles a message that he should seize power before the 23rd of October saying that he would expect no opposition due to the political situation and his restoration would be greeted everywhere. Charles whom got the message after dictating his will made a daredevil flight (the plane’s engine stopped working several times) in an Ad Astra Aero Junkers F.13 monoplane landing surreptitiously in Western Hungary on a field belonging to a legitimist and from there making his way to Sopron. He had no intention to seek compromise with Horthy whose cabinet he considered illegitimate and formed his own provisional government. That day a group of armored trains were being equipped in Sopron guarded by Ostenburg’s troops who were told a communist rebellion erupted in Budapest with Horthy calling on Charles to restore order. The battalion took the traditional Honved oath of Loyalty to ‘Charles of Hapsburg, King of Hungary, and King of Bohemia’. From there they departed to Budapest 190 km away in the late morning. The armada stopped at each village station to have the local garrison and public officials take the oath of loyalty and to allow groups of loyal peasants chant ‘Long live the King!’ and pay homage to the royal couple. This took approximately 10 hours which then had allowed Horthy to regroup. A report reached Horthy late on October 21st and he was shocked Lehar and Ostenburg betrayed him and Horthy communicated his decision that force would be used if necessary citing the danger Hungary would be destroyed and made a military proclamation he would keep power and demanded loyalty from his army. Most who were stationed along the Royal Armada's path found it impossible to be disloyal to Charles. As Charles approached Budapest the Entente powers reaffirmed their opposition to the restoration and Czech, Yugoslav, and Rumanian ministers made it clear such a move would be regarded as a Casus Belli. Horthy then sent a letter telling Charles, begging him to give up but the latter did not even read the letter."

Martial law at this time was already declared in Budapest. Czechoslovakia at the same time reported and claimed to be mobilising. Thomas Hohler the British envoy was convinced all was lost anticipating that Charles would ender Budapest that afternoon. Horthy received news that if the legitimists launched an attack the defense of Budapest would collapse. General Pal Hegedus who was a legitimist allied with Charles met with Hohler the British envoy whom informed him that Britain “Would never recognise Charles and would never permit the return of a Habsburg.”. Later warning Budapest if taken by Royal Troops would be overrun by the Czechs within a week. Hegedus now denied being associated with Charles and offered brokering an armistice after learning that Charles' assurances that the Great Powers backed him were false. Horthy later that day met with a large volunteer force which had been guarding the city giving a speech warning if Charles came to power A-H would be revived and Hungary once again would resume her inferior position. He also said that Charles’ army consisted mostly of “Austrian and Czech Volunteers”. This emboldened the army which began firing on Charles's forces. After news of the Battle of Budaors (A village close to Budapest) was spread much of Charles' supporters were surprised and lost morale thinking the march would be Budapest. After Charles’ army saw that Horthy was determined to resist and found that Charles and his officers lied that there was an eruption of a Bolshevik rebellion in budapest support grew to Pro-Horthy. By now Charles reluctantly agreed to an armistice and arranged a truce the next morning."

In return of this all supporters of the restoration, “except agitators and ringleaders”, would be amnestied. Whilst Charles read these terms shots rang out and a stray bullet hit the royal train and the train started to move westward with Lehra and Ostenburg calling for a ‘Last Stand’ and ‘Fight to the last drop of blood’, but Charles was largely reluctant to do this and ordered the train to stop and opened the window yelling  "Lehár! Ostenburg! Stop and come back here! I forbid any more fighting! It's all quite senseless now...". He then dictated the final surrender order.

Harding, who succeeded Woodrow Wilson in March 1921, had campaigned against the occupations of both Haiti and the Dominican Republic. In june 1921, United states representatives present a withdrawal proposal, known as the Harding Plan, which called for Dominican ratification of all acts of the military government, approval of a loan of $2.5 million US dollars for public works and other expenses, the acceptance of United States officers of the constabulary, and the holding of elections under United States supervision. Popular reaction to the plan was overwhelmingly negative. Moderate Dominican leaders however, used the plan as the basis for further negotiations that resulted in an agreement between U.S. Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes and Dominican Ambassador to the United States Francisco J. Peynado on June 30th, 1922, allowing for the selection of a provisional president to rule until elections could be organized.  In the presidential election of March 15th, 1924, Horacio Vásquez Lajara, an American ally who cooperated with the U.S. Government handily defeated Peynado. With his inauguration on July 13th, control of the republic returned to Dominican hands."

The purpose of this mission was to send a number of high level personages from Britain and France to Poland in an attempt to influence Polish policy. The mission members included French diplomat Jean Jules Jusserand, General Maxime Weygand, chief of staff to marshal Ferdinand Foch and the British Diplomat Lord Edgar Vincent D’abernon. The crucial battle of Warsaw was won in the early days of August, before the mission could achieve anything of importance. The only tangible result being the installation of Weygand as an advisor to the Polish General Staff, where his role was negligible. Nevertheless, after the battle and for various political reasons, a myth arose that Weygand was the author of the Polish Victory in the battle of Warsaw."

Following the Kiel mutiny however Wilhelm II lost all hope and the navy was his greatest joy and achievement for which once it rebelled he had realized that the war had indeed been lost and seeing the fate of the Russian Royal Family, his cousins, he abdicated on November 9th which was announced by the Chancellor, Prince Max von Baden in a proclamation on that same day and went into exile in Holland. The Kaiser’s abdication proclamation was formally published on the 30th of November 1918 and facing much criticism over the nature of the abdication the German Army Chief of Staff.

Within the Treaty of Versaille Germany was to accept responsibility of 'Germany and her allies for causing all loss and damage during the war'. This was one of the most important and controversial things required which became later known as the 'War Guilt caluse'. In whole the treaty forced Germany to disarm, make territorial concessions to France, Belgium, and Poland, pay reparations assessed at 132 billion marks equivalent to 442 Billion USD in 2017. Many people at the time viewed the treaty as "too harsh" whilst others such as Ferdinand Foch the French Field Marshal saw it as too lenient saying "This is not a peace. It is an armistice for 20 years" for which he was all but a 3 months off."

After that it was suggested they be interned at Scapa Flow, Britain with a skeleton crew of German sailors being guarded by the Grand Fleet and such was agreed upon. Once at Scapa Flow the mood amongst the sailors was still very mutinous and all of them had been heavily demoralized unable to go ashore and the food supplies coming from Germany of very poor quality. In addition none of the sailors were allowed to visit other ships or communicate. At the negotiations at the Paris Peace Conference the French and Italians wanted a quarter of the ships whilst the British wanted all of them destroyed since they saw redistribution as a threat to the supremacy of the Royal Navy. Rear-Admiral Ludwig von Reuter who had been given command of the ship's heard of the possible terms and began to prepare detailed plans to scuttle his ships, on June 18th he gave out orders which stated “It is my intention to sink the ships only if the enemy should attempt to obtain possession of them without the assent of our government.” While the signing of Versaille was scheduled for noon 21 June 1919 the First Battle Squadron prepared to board the German ships to check for signs of the crew preparing to scuttle however they had been misinformed the deadline of the treaty was extended to 19:00 23 June. Around 10:00 a.m. on 21 June 1919 Ludwig von Reuter sent a signal flag ordering the fleet to scuttle which began almost immediately. There was no noticeable effect until noon when the ‘Friedrich der Grosse’ began to list heavily starboard and all the ships hoisted the Imperial German Ensign on their main masts. It was a great disaster for the Allies as 52 of the 74 ships sunk. Whilst Admiral Fremantle in charge of the supervision of the German surface fleet scorned Von Reuter and his men he privately remarked “I could not resist feeling some sympathy for von Reuter, who had preserved his dignity when placed against his will in a highly unpleasant and invidious position."

In whole, the treaty forced France to disarm, make various territorial concesiions to Germany, as well pay reparations assessed at around 100 billion marks.

However, whilst we could just end our conflict with Japan in ceding our Asian colonies reluctantly with a sour attitude we could always play nice with the Japanese and offer them French Indochina as well, not only would this cement good relations between our two nations and show that Germany is not an enemy of Japan but the Japanese likely will in in a decade or two aspire to controll British colonies in the Pacific, combined with both of our Naval power we could put that Empire to rest should it come to it."

This leaves the same possibility of practically anyone coming to power in Russia once a coup occurs. \n\n Remember...Murphy's Law, anything that can go wrong will go wrong."

Gaining prominence in 1940 as a commander of a panzer division that smashed the French defenses, Rommel went on to command the Afrika Korps where his tactical genius, ability to inspire his troops and make the best of limited resources, prompted Hitler to elevate him to the rank of Field Marshall. In 1943, Hitler placed Rommel in command of fortifying the \"Atlantic Wall\" along the coast of France defenses intended to repel the inevitable invasion of Europe by the Allies. \n\nBy the beginning of 1943, Rommel's faith in Germany's ability to win the war was crumbling, as was his estimation of Hitler. Touring Germany, Rommel was appalled at the devastation of the Allied bombing raids and the erosion of the peoples' morale. He also learned for the first time of the death camps, slave labor, the extermination of the Jews and the other atrocities of the Nazi regime. Rommel became convinced that victory for Germany was a lost cause and that prolonging the war would lead to his homeland's devastation. He came in contact with a growing conspiracy dedicated to ousting Hitler and establishing a separate peace with the western allies. \n\nOn July 17, 1944, Rommel's car was hit by an Allied aircraft strike, severely wounding the Field Marshall. He was taken to a hospital and then to his home in Germany. Three days later, an assassin's bomb nearly killed Hitler. In the gory reprisals that followed, some suspects implicated Rommel. Rommel's \"defeatist\" attitude was enough to warrant Hitler's wrath. He forced Rommel to either undergo a trial where he would certainly be found guilty or take his own life. He chose the latter."

 germany_1941.1.d:0 "The Government of National Salvation, also referred to as the Nedić's regime, was the second Serbian puppet government, after the Commissioner Government, established on the Territory of the German Military Commander in Serbia during World War II. It was appointed by the German Military Commander in Serbia and operated from 29 August 1941 to October 1944. It was initially instated because the previous government did not have the means to control the Communist partisans."

 germany_1941.2.d:0 "After we arrived in Ukraine, we faced an enormous amount of resistance from the Soviet Union.

Being oppressed heavily by the Soviet Union, purposefully starved, massacred and more, they saw the German Reich as their liberator. With the recent occupation of Ukrainian clay, the occupier had to decide on their policy against the Ukrainians. There are many considered \"unworthy\" by the German people, such as Slavs and jews, and the German people might turn against us if we do not act convincingly."

 germany_1941.5.d:0 "The Uprising in Serbia was initiated in July 1941 by the Communist Party of Yugoslavia against the German occupation forces and their Serbian quisling auxiliaries in the Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia. At first the Yugoslav Partisans had mounted diversions and conducted sabotage and had attacked representatives of Acimovic's quisling administration. In late August some Chetniks joined the uprising and liberated Loznica. The uprising soon reached mass proportions. \n\nPartisans and Chetniks captured towns that weak German garrisons had abandoned. The armed uprising soon engulfed great parts of the occupied territory. The largest liberated territory in occupied Europe was created by the Partisans in western Serbia, and was known as the Republic of Uzice. Rebels shared power on the liberated territory; the center of the Partisan liberated territory was in Uzice, and Chetniks had their headquarters on Ravna Gora."

 germany_1941.6.d:0 "Due to the collapse of the Yugoslav Army, the general population of Montenegro had easy access to large amounts of military arms and ammunition. By July 1941, the Communist Party of Yugoslavia had over 1,800 members and another 3,000 youth members, located in the area of Montenegro, Kotor and the Sandzak. Most of these were ready to commence an armed uprising against the Axis powers and the occupying Italians in particular. Grievances mainly related to the expulsion of Montenegrin people from the Kosovo region and Vojvodina, as well as the influx of refugees from other parts of Yugoslavia. Other refugees were fleeing the terror of the Ustaše in the regions along the borders with Bosnia and Herzegovina. \n\n But the event that triggered the uprising was the proclamation of a restored Kingdom of Montenegro headed by an Italian regent and led by Montenegrin separatist Sekula Drljević and his supporters, known as \"Greens\". This proclamation was announced by the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It was issued to the Italian-convoked assembly of Montenegrin separatists held on 12 July 1941. The uprising broke out the following day."

############### ENGLAND EVENTS ###################
 ENG_1941.1.t:0 "Operation Countenance"
 ENG_1941.1.d:0 "For many decades, Iran and the German Empire had cultivated ties, partly as a counter to the imperial ambitions of Britain and the Russian Empire, and later, the Soviet Union. Trading with Germany appealed to Iran because the Germans did not have a history of imperialism in the region, unlike the British and Russians. Iranian embassies in occupied European capitals by Germans rescued over 1,500 Jews and secretly granted them Iranian citizenship, allowing them to move to Iran. The British began to accuse Iran of supporting Nazism and being pro-German. Although Reza Shah declared neutrality at an early stage of World War II, Iran assumed greater strategic importance to the British government, which feared that the Abadan Refinery might fall into German hands; producing eight million tons of oil in 1940, the refinery was a crucial part of the Allied war effort. \n\nFollowing Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, Britain and the Soviet Union became formal Allies, providing further impetus for an Allied invasion. With the German Army steadily advancing through the Soviet Union, the Persian Corridor formed by the Trans-Iranian Railway was one of the easiest ways for the Allies to get Lend-Lease supplies to the Soviets, sent by sea from the United States. British and Soviet planners recognised the importance of that railway and sought to control it. As increasing U-boat attacks and winter ice made convoys to Arkhangelsk dangerous, the railway became an increasingly attractive route..."

 ww1_finland.9.d:0 "The Moscow Peace Treaty was signed in Moscow on 12 March 1940. A cease-fire took effect the next day at noon Leningrad time, 11 a.m. Helsinki time. With it, Finland ceded a portion of Karelia, the entire Karelian Isthmus and land north of Lake Ladoga. The area included Finland's fourth-largest city of Vyborg, much of Finland's industrialised territory, and significant land still held by Finland's military—all in all, 11 percent of the territory and 30 percent of the economic assets of pre-war Finland. Twelve percent of Finland's population, 422,000 to 450,000 Karelians, were evacuated and lost their homes. Finland ceded a part of the region of Salla, Rybachy Peninsula in the Barents Sea, and four islands in the Gulf of Finland. The Hanko peninsula was leased to the Soviet Union as a military base for 30 years. The region of Petsamo, captured by the Red Army during the war, was returned to Finland according to the treaty. A drawing shows that the Finns ceded a small part of Rybachy Peninsula and part of Salla in the Finnish Lapland; and a part of Karelia and the islands of the Gulf of Finland in the south as well as a lease on the Hanko peninsula in southwestern Finland. Finnish concessions and territorial losses exceeded Soviet pre-war demands. Before the war, the Soviet Union demanded that the frontier between the USSR and Finland on the Karelian Isthmus be moved westward to a point 30 kilometres (19 mi) east of Vyborg to the line between Koivisto and Lipola, that existing fortifications on the Karelian Isthmus be demolished, and the islands of Suursaari, Tytärsaari, and Koivisto in the Gulf of Finland and Rybachy Peninsula be ceded. In exchange, the Soviet Union proposed ceding Repola and Porajärvi from Eastern Karelia, an area twice as large as the territories originally demanded from the Finns."

Particularly on the Ladoga Karelia front and during the battle of Raate road, the Finns isolated smaller portions of numerically superior Soviet forces.
