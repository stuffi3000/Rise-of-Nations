May circles on the edge of the fight until he sights Richtofen's cousin Wolfram crossing his front, Richtofen sees his cousin under fire and closes in, opens fire. The inexperienced May, falls out of control probably saving his life. Richtofen breaks his own rule and follows him down as may plunges earthward but he regains control just over the Somme and follows the river West - and to the safety of his own lines. May's friend Roy Brown sees the pursuit and dives to help, a low level chase follows. With a strong easterly wind, Richtofen is pushed further and further over enemy lines... alone... and under constant ground fire. Richtofen seems to become target fixated, unaware of Brown diving behind him; at this exact time Cedric Popkin, of the 24th Australian Machine Gun Company fires at the Red Triplane along with soldiers from the 53rd Battery, Royal Australian Artillery. As Brown fires a burst the Triplane rears up to the right, near Vaux-sur-Somme, Richtofen receives a single, fatal, bullet wound to the chest."
