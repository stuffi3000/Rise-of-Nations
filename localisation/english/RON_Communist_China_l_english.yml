He was found lying on the floor in his bedroom prior to doctors being called. Using leeches as treatment to no avail, Stalin's double was recalled from vacation to stand in as Stalin if needed. However, Stalin's health was later braodcasted throughout moscow in detail. The day after, Joseph Stalin was pronounced dead.\n\nStalin's cult of personality is expected to go on after his demise. And a power struggle has already underway as powerful members of the party are enthusiatic to rise to the vacant position left by Stalin."
