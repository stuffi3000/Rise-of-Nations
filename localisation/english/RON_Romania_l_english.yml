While stopping short of outright praise, the report nevertheless comes as a blow to those that were critisizing the Government and demanding reforms.\n\nA number of Deputies have already publically declared that although they still harbour doubts about the Government's agenda, they will now vote in support."
 rom.45.a:0 "As well they should."
 rom.46.t:0 "Senator retires"
 rom.46.desc:0 "Following a minor heart attack, a senior Senator announced today that he will be retiring for health reasons. With more than two decades in the Parliament, the Senator built a large network of supporters and his influence carried a lot of weight. While technically only one man with one vote, Bucharest insiders nonetheless counted him as worth several votes as he was the key to secure several others. With the seat most likely going to an avowed critic of [ROM.GetLeader], the Administration will find it a lot harder to secure the necessary votes to pass bills."
 rom.46.a:0 "He will be missed. And his vote as well."
 rom.47.t:0 "Chamber hearings into Governmental misconduct"
 rom.47.desc:0 "A minor scandal originating in the Victory Palace has started to gain momentum. Following weeks of media reports implying that a minor administrative official had been taking bribes in return for lucrative Government contracts, the Chamber Committe on Expenditures in the Executive has begun to hold hearings to determine if the Head of the Government was aware of this. While most observers don't believe that this will lead to any major trouble for [ROM.GetLeader], it will no doubt mean that many of the [ROM.GetLeader]'s supporters will have to lay low for a while."
 rom.47.a:0 "A witchhunt."
 rom.61.t:0 "Senator from [ROM_congress_investment_state.GetName] offers Support"
 rom.61.desc:0 "The senior Senator from [ROM_congress_investment_state.GetName] has approached the Government with an offer of support. His state suffers from critical under-investment, and a Government-initiated economic stimulus program would certainly make him reconsider his stance on certain proposed Government policies. The Senator sits on several important committees, and is quite famous for being able to cut deals, making his vote worth several more in both chambers."
 rom.61.a:0 "It is a very underdeveloped region."
 rom.61.b:0 "This smells of corruption."
 rom.62.desc:0 "The Senators from [ROM_congress_investment_state.GetName] have approached the Government, offering their support for the President in return for an informal guarantee that [ROM_congress_investment_state.GetName] would be the site of a new munitions plant for the Army. They argue that building a plant in the area would create a lot of jobs and provide the Army with much needed support in an increasingly dangerous world. The two Senators also mentioned their excellent working relationship with several influential members of the Parliament."
 rom.62.a:0 "They make a lot of good points."
 rom.62.b:0 "These kinds of deals are below my atributions."
 rom.63.t:0 "Deputies from [ROM_congress_investment_state.GetName] offer Support"
 rom.63.desc:0 "The parliamentary Delegation from [ROM_congress_investment_state.GetName] have approached the Government with several suggestions to improve the infrastructure of the state. Government funding should be made available to upgrade roads and bridges in order to promote commerce between the regions. They also noted that support from the Government in this would certainly make them more inclined to support the Government more directly in its agenda."
 rom.63.a:0 "A commendable initiative."
 rom.63.b:0 "Let them try to push that through by themselves."
 rom.64.t:0 "Senate Committee investigates shipbuilding in [ROM_congress_investment_state.GetName]"
 rom.64.desc:0 "Prodded by the senior Senator from [ROM_congress_investment_state.GetName], the Senate Commerce Committee has begun hearings into the state of the local shipbuilding industry. According to experts, a significant percentage of Romania's trade depends on overseas trade, and the country is desperately lacking in shipbuilding capacity. [ROM_congress_investment_state.GetName] has been identified as a region in which a major investment should be made, and several committee members have expressed an expectation that the Government of [ROM.GetLeader] will set funds aside for this."
 rom.64.a:0 "A critical weakness."
 rom.64.b:0 "We have bigger problems."
