 news.130.d:0 "French forces have successfully stormed the German capital, which fell after a series of pitched battles within the city limits. A large group of Waffen-SS soldiers barricaded themselves in the Olympiastadion, which eventually fell after a determined attack by Foreign Legionnaires supported by artillery.\n\nThe French tricolor can now be seen flying over the Reich Chancellery, and although sporadic fighting is still being reported from some suburbs, most of Berlin is believed to have been cleared of organized resistance."

 news.155.t:0 "Germany At War Again"
 news.155.d:0 "Although many have wished for a long lasting peace in Europe, a recent turn of events has left the German Empire on the path to war once again. German troops have mobilized and are ready to go on the offense."
 news.155.a:0 "This may be the beginning of another War"

 news.173.t:0 "The Third International"
 news.173.d_1:0 "A number of communist delegates from around the world met in [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] today for a founding conference. With supporters of Marx's theories taking the lead, the groundwork for the Third International was laid.\n\nAlthough it is still unclear what impact these efforts of organize will have on the international political stage, Many socialists expect this to be a step towards the realisation of a socialist world revolution."
 news.173.a:0 "Jesus, cut it out!"
 news.173.b:0 "A glorious day for the revolution."

 news.291.t:0 "Austria restores the Habsburger monarchy"
 news.291.desc:0 "Austria has carried out a referendum on the possible restoration of the monarchy, under the Habsburg crown. The final count has almost been completed, but it is already clear that it is a landslide victory for the restoration camp. No irregularities in the voting process have been reported, and the Austrian government has found itself obligated to reform into a monarchy of the Habsburgs.\n\nThough the move is greatly welcomed by the loyalists, the political repercussions of the referendum will likely be felt keenly throughout Europe."
 news.291.a:0 "Look who's back."
 news.291.b:0 "A revival of the Austria-Hungary!"
 news.291.c:0 "The Empire's power-vacuum may yet be filled..."

 news.409.t:0 "Yellow River Blown"
 news.409.desc:0 "In a last ditch attempt to halt the oncoming might of the aggressor forces, the network of dikes and flood defenses along the Yellow River were destroyed by the [FROM.GetAdjective] army.\n\nThe ensuing flash floods have displaced huge numbers of the rural population, who were given only a brief window to prepare.\n\nIt remains to be seen if this act can buy the [FROM.GetAdjective] military enough time to regroup and face further combat."
 news.409.a:0 "Understood."
 news.409.b:0 "This cannot stop the inevitable."
 news.409.c:0 "A humanitarian tragedy."
 
 political.1.t:0 "Socialism on the Rise"
 political.1.d:0 "'While workers rise up against their oppressors around the world, those who claim to have achieved class consciousness in [Root.GetName] sit idly by and wait for change to come from within a political system so thoroughly corrupt, only revolution could save us from it!'\n\nSo speak new voices in the [Root.GetAdjective] socialist movement. Referring to the rule of [Root.GetRulingParty] as a dictatorship of the bourgeois, they have begun calling for it to be brought out of power by any means necessary. Whether those means will come from within or without remains to be seen."
 political.1.a.tt:0 "Increases the chance of internal support for a socialist coup."
 political.1.b.tt:0 "Increases the chance of popular support for a socialist uprising."
 political.2.d:0 "Although the party line of the [Root.GetRulingParty] is to strongly oppose revolutionary socialism, keeping a watchful eye on the nation's radical left-wing elements, some people in government are more open to the possibility. If nothing else, they see room for addressing the concerns of the people who look to socialists for solutions without risking a full-scale civil war.\n\nAlthough they may be seen as traitors by those who remain loyal to [Root.GetLeader], these dissident voices may be the ones to ensure a relatively bloodless transition should the revolution come."
 political.3.t:0 "Socialists Execute Coup"
 political.3.d:0 "While the popular movement for socialist revolution has been loud and terrifying, a certain section of the political movement has been largely quiet and waiting. The wait is now over. Today, just as the [Root.GetRulingParty] leadership and army were bracing for a revolt on national scale, a number of officials in the [Root.GetAdjective] government swiftly placed [Root.GetLeader] under house arrest and entered negotiations with the rebels.\n\nWhile retaining a pretense of safeguarding order, what the negotiations effectively amounted to was to secure positions within the new socialist state for those who chose to cooperate. The coup was finished before anyone could move to stop it, and those who would have are now imprisoned, exiled or executed by the new regime."
 political.4.d:0 "The socialist revolutionary movement, once a fringe popular among radical academics in theory and troublemakers in practice, has seen increased support among the [Root.GetAdjective] working class. The fact that even more people choose to identify themselves with a 'class' at all implies that Marxist ideas are spreading beyond those who actively seek to overthrow the government.\n\n[Root.GetRulingParty] members lament this development, longing for a time when '[Root.GetAdjective]' was what people identified as first and foremost. Their concerns are not unfounded. It could be argued that a revolution is already underway, occurring on several levels of society, and it may be too late to stop it."
 political.5.t:0 "Soldiers Desert to Socialist Partisans"
 political.5.d:0 "'Capitalists and nationalists would have you spill your blood for them on the front lines, turning brother against brother over disputes that do not concern the working man! Instead of taking up arms against workers who struggle abroad, raise them against the oppressors and overthrow the tyrants!'\n\nThe army, usually a bastion of patriotism and loyalty, has proven not to be immune to the socialist propaganda spreading rapidly in [Root.GetName]. Soldiers are deserting, refusing to fight for their country, sometimes going as far as joining partisan movements that claim to be preparing for revolution."
 political.6.d:0 "The notion that the socialist movement represents the people has certainly gotten wind in its sails in [Root.GetName], where the public support for the socialist party has increased rapidly in the past months. But those who call for revolution are no longer a disparate collection of guerrillas and disgruntled labor unions. The group behind the call for revolt is organized enough to form a government if they succeed.\n\nNevertheless, if the revolution started now, it could hardly be executed without launching [Root.GetName] into civil war. Should the revolutionaries risk tearing the nation in two to satisfy their impatience, or wait for a better opportunity in the future?"
 political.7.t:0 "Right-wing Radicalism on the Rise"
 political.7.d:1 "'The [Root.GetAdjective] people have been subjected too long to the incompetent rule of [Root.GetRulingParty]! They claim to represent the people, but fail to even keep our streets in order! Only by removing them from power can we make this nation grow!'\n\nThe nationalist speakers in [Root.GetName] have made no secret of what they think of our current leadership and political system. Speeches like these have tapped into a public dissent that is particularly pronounced in the more conservative sections of the military."
 political.7.a.tt:0 "Increases the chance of internal support for a nationalist coup."
 political.7.b.tt:0 "Increases the chance of popular support for a nationalist coup."
 political.8.t:0 "Radical Right-wing Sympathies in the Military"
 political.8.d:1 "Several high-ranking members of the [Root.GetAdjective] military have expressed support, some privately and some openly, for the Radical Right-wing movement in [Root.GetName]. They feel the [Root.GetRulingParty] has forgotten how important force of arms is to keeping the country together, and are increasingly annoyed by the army being treated by the government as more of a tool than a one of the nation's most important institutions. Some of them go as far as to suggest that a new government is needed, one that knows how to lead [Root.GetName] into the century.\n\nThis faction may not predominantly be politicians, but some of them have gained positions in the department of defense. If these developments continue, they may have sufficient political support to execute a coup."
 political.8.a:0 "The national spirit outranks the government."
 political.9.t:0 "Nationalist Coup d'état"
 political.9.d:0 "Some will say they saw it coming. Both those who warned against the dangers of right-wing radicalism and those who extolled it as the savior of [Root.GetName] have found their prophecies made reality today, as the military in [Root.Capital.GetName] overthrew the [Root.GetRulingParty]-led government and seized power. [Root.GetLeader] is missing, rumored to have gone into exile, and the coup has been met with little initial resistance.\n\nThe new [Root.GetAdjective] leadership has no plans to allow resistance to grow, either. Martial law has been declared and with the changes that are underway, whatever comes after is unlikely to be very different."
 political.10.t:0 "Civil War for Nationalism"
 political.10.d:1 "While the attempts of the radical right-wing movement to revive nationalistic sentiment have seen some success, the resistance against these ideas remains high. The generals plotting to overthrow the current administration are disappointed in the lack of confidence the [Root.GetAdjective] population themselves seem to have in [Root.GetFascistParty].\n\nThey remain certain that the people will eventually tire of [Root.GetLeader], but are divided on what course of action to take. Some call for a coup to be executed now, before [Root.GetName]'s enemies take action. However, doing so while public support is limited would plunge the nation into civil war."
 political.11.t:0 "Radical Right-wing Assault Divisions Form"
 political.11.d:0 "The political and the martial have always been intertwined in right-wing radicalism. In parallel with its growing political movement, nationalist parties have begun to form paramilitary organizations to protect against both internal and external threats, the internal threats being their political opponents. Although many people find this development worrying, the wave of militaristic furor has led to an increased amount of volunteers joining our armed forces.\n\nThe political leaders of the movement have pointed out that their opponents have reason to be afraid. Having the army permeated on several levels by so explicitly political elements, the enemies of [Root.GetName] and the enemies of right-wing radicalism are beginning to look very much alike."
 political.12.t:0 "The Threat of Socialism"
 political.12.d:0 "'[Root.GetLeader] would have you believe [Root.GetName] stands safe and united. It is no surprise such lies have poisoned the minds of our people, when a snake is coiled up next door! Look no further than across our border to see countrymen having turned on each other in the name of socialism, declaring the end of nations. How long until they declare our nation dead as well? Will the [Root.GetRulingParty] protect us from this threat?'\n\nThe growth of the nationalist movement in [Root.GetName] has been bolstered by the proximity of the socialist revolution. Many moderates who might normally dismiss right-wing radicalism as another misguided ideological experiment find this to be a very real concern for them as well. Given the choice between the socialism of our neighbors and a nationalist regime, they would admittedly prefer the latter. They might even be willing to actively support it."
 political.18.t:0 "Nationalists Demand Referendum"
 political.18.d:1 "The rapidly growing [Root.GetAdjective] nationalist movement has never claimed that they need majority support before they seize power, counting on uniting the nation under their leadership once their rule is established. However, it seems their public support has grown rapidly. Many right-wing radicals are now calling [Root.GetLeader] a hypocrite, claiming to represent the wishes of the people while in reality turning a deaf ear to the masses.\n\nThe call for a referendum has been dismissed as typical attempts at disrupting the system by [Root.GetRulingParty] members so far, but at least it's a political measure. If we do not act now, the nationalists may choose the violent struggle as a better path to power."
 political.19.t:0 "Socialists Demand Referendum"
 political.19.d:0 "Marxist ideas took root in [Root.GetName] a long time ago, but have gained much more widespread support lately. The movement has spread outside political theory and into political practice, with disgruntled workers and even some high-profile celebrities voicing support. The socialists call this class consciousness. The [Root.GetRulingParty] call it a fast track to riots and treason.\n\nShowing little faith in [Root.GetLeader] being willing to implement the reforms they demand, the more vocal socialists have called for an immediate referendum to have the current government removed. While we might be able to reverse the momentum of this mass movement, failure to do so will doubtlessly result in the more popular socialist method of removal: Revolution."
 political.21.t:0 "Nationalists March on [Root.Capital.GetName]"
 political.21.d:0 "Having been refused their referendum, almost a token attempt at seizing power legally, the nationalists have used their significant public support and connections in the [Root.GetAdjective] military to attempt a coup. The [Root.GetRulingParty] government has refused their terms and claims it is going to fight to the end to preserve [Root.GetName] as we know it."
 political.21.b:0 "The nationalists carry the true spirit of [Root.GetName]!"
 political.22.t:0 "Socialists Rise Up"
 political.22.d:0 "After their request for a referendum was denied, the few reformers of the socialist movement in [Root.GetName] rapidly lost influence to the more radical elements. With the [Root.GetRulingParty]'s refusal to acknowledge the public support for the suggested reforms, the romantic view of the revolution gradually grew more widespread and the leaders of the movement become those who could most easily start a riot. Those riots have now erupted into a full-scale civil war, with the future of the nation at stake."
 political.24.t:0 "Nationalists Ridiculed"
 political.24.d:0 "The [Root.GetAdjective] people's infatuation with nationalistic pride and attempts to revive the glories of the past appears to have passed. A rude awakening for its ardent supporters, whose uniforms, militaristic posturing and over-the-top speeches are now more commonly the subject of mockery than sympathies.\n\nOnce considered a threat to the [Root.GetRulingParty] power base, [Root.GetAdjective] right-wing radicalism is now increasingly seen as an absurd, extremist position and an attack on the most fundamental values of our nation, the very nation they claim to hold in such high regard. The word seems more suited as an insult than a political designation."
 political.25.t:0 "Socialist Fad Blows Over"
 political.25.d:0 "Many socialists had predicted that [Root.GetName] was going to be the next nation to fall to the so-called international revolution, but after a few months of strikes and red flags in the streets, the movement seems to have died down. The working class, the supposed driving force of the revolution, has more pressing concerns than overthrowing [Root.GetLeader] and seem decidedly unimpressed with how well these revolutions have played out elsewhere. Meanwhile, the intellectuals who wrote passionate calls for slitting the throats of the oppressors have turned out to be surprisingly reluctant to instigate anything that might actually upset their comfortable lifestyle.\n\nTalk of the revolution will likely continue, whether over cheap beers or expensive wines, but it will likely be talk and nothing more."
 political.27.t:0 "[Root.GetLeader] Abandons Neutral Foreign Policy"
 political.27.d_fascism:1 "After [Root.GetRulingParty]'s recent rise to power, [Root.GetLeader] announced that [Root.GetName] would no longer keep its Neutral Foreign Policy.\n'The world has become tangled and complex. We are no longer safe on our own. We must stand with our nationalist partners against our enemies. If we do not choose a side, we will perish alone.'"
 political.27.d_communism:0 "After [Root.GetRulingParty]'s recent rise to power, [Root.GetLeader] announced that [Root.GetName] would no longer keep its Neutral Foreign Policy.\n'The world has become tangled and complex. This country has always stood on it principles and been ready to defend them. We are no longer safe on our own. Neutrality is no longer the safe haven it used to be and those who seek power in this world do not respect it. We must stand with our socialist brothers against the powers that seek to oppress us. Against the bourgeois majority who wants nothing more than keep us down. If we do not take a stand, we will perish alone.'"
 
 election.4.t:0 "Election: Nationalists in Government?"
 election.4.d:0 "An aggressively nationalist sentiment has grown in [Root.GetName], giving rise to several parties promoting nationalist ideals: a state enforcing its power through force. One of these in particular has won favor in the current election, leading to discussions within the [Root.GetRulingParty] party about whether or not we should try to cooperate with them in forming our government. While they openly reject the democratic ideals that are the foundation of our state, the fact that they choose to participate in the election itself lends some credibility to our views and acknowledging their public support may keep them away from taking violent action."
 election.4.a:0 "Rather them than the socialists!"
 election.5.t:0 "Election: Socialists in Government?"
 election.5.d:0 "The socialist movement in [Root.GetName], fueled by broad dissatisfaction among the working class and radical trends among academics, has grown large enough to lead to the formation of several parties. After one of these has gained considerable support in the current election, politicians in [Root.GetRulingParty] have started debating whether or not to seek their support in forming a government. Although they consider our democratic institutions to be little more than bourgeois tyranny, they seem eager to make the changes they want to see through cooperating with the government rather than overthrowing it."
 election.6.t:0 "Election: Democratic Parties in Minority"
 election.6.d:0 "Politics in [Root.GetName] have grown increasingly radicalized. Where there was once broad support for the parties which supported democratic ideals and [Root.GetName]'s representative institutions, more voters have turned to the political extremes in this election. The parties in the political middle, even if they choose to set aside their differences, no longer form a majority. To avoid a weak minority government, we have no choice but to cooperate with either nationalists or socialists."
 election.6.a:0 "We will work with the nationalists to strengthen [Root.GetName]."
 election.6.b:0 "Joining with the socialists, we can facilitate social change."
 election.7.t:0 "Nationalists Influence Foreign Policy"
 election.7.d:1 "Accepting the nationalists into our political coalition has had an impact on our foreign policy. Despite their vehement nationalism, they have sympathizers abroad who approve of the influence they've been given in [Root.GetName]. Autocratic governments of similar ideological leanings see us as potential allies. Maintaining ties to these nations, no matter the distaste [Root.GetRulingParty] may have for their ideals, may be necessary to retain the support of the nationalists backing our government."
 election.8.t:0 "Socialists Influence Foreign Policy"
 election.8.d:0 "Socialists often consider themselves to be part of an international revolution, and our choice to accept them as partners in our government has drawn the attention of many of their international allies. Representatives of socialist parties maintain close ties to nations which have abandoned our form of government in favor of a dictatorship of the proletariat, ties which we may need to acknowledge in [Root.GetAdjective] foreign policy if we wish to retain their support."
 election.11.t:0 "Election: Nationalist Majority"
 election.11.d:0 "This election has been devastating for the very institution it represents. The majority of the [Root.GetAdjective] population have cast their vote in favor of a nationalist party that seeks to abolish elections and install an autocratic ruler. While many consider taking up arms against this violation of the democratic ideals that allowed them this mandate to begin with, others consider the use of violence to only confirm their ideals further."
 election.12.t:0 "Election: Socialist Majority"
 election.12.d:0 "The current election has resulted in victory for the socialist parties, with mixed reactions from the former administration. While the new rulers claim to represent the people as a whole, they view many of the democratic institutions we cherish as attempts to manipulate and oppress the working class, leading to discussion about what truly constitutes a 'rule of the people'. In some nations, the revolution began in rivers of blood. In [Root.GetName] it didn't, but it may yet end in them."
 election.13.t:0 "Election: Magnate Favors Nationalism"
 election.13.d:0 "An influential industrialist behind one of the companies we have chosen to work with for our industrial production has recently made a number of statements on politics that members of the administration found troubling. He has openly advocated an authoritarian government and praised foreign administrations that identify as nationalist, implicitly suggesting that [Root.GetName] would benefit from such rulership. Denouncing the magnate and his ideals might sour our relationship with the company, but leaving them unchecked would give him a platform for spreading propaganda that erodes all that [Root.GetRulingParty] stands for."
 election.13.b:0 "We cannot rely on nationalists to develop and protect [Root.GetName]."

In but a few years, the [FROM.GetOldAdjectiveCap]s have utterly dominated the Balkans, reconquered Konstantiniyye, and crushed any organized Turkish resistance in Anatolia. It seems that the death of the Roman Empire now seems to have 'reborn in the purple' after five centuries.\n\nTo further bolster national pride, the [From.GetOldAdjectiveCap] government has utilized historical continuity, and styled their military achievements as a 'Byzantine reconquest against the Turkic invader'.
