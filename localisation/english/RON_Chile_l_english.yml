The liberals will be made to understand and we shall gain their support."
 CHL_isi_idea:0 "Import Substitution Economics"

 CHL_infantry_focus:0 "Infantry Focus"
 CHL_infantry_focus_desc:0 "Tanks may be an interesting experiment but Chile does not have the industry to pursue such fanciful escapades. We should rely on tried and tested methods of warfare: infantry and artillery."

 CHL_surface_fleet_focus:0 "Surface Fleet"
 CHL_surface_fleet_focus_desc:0 "The tried and tested methods of naval warfare shall suit us perfectly. There is no obstacle that can withstand the fusillade of a battleship."
 CHL_destroyer_focus:0 "Destroyer Focus"

 CHL_military_research_institute_desc:0 "Our military has grown large and with it has our experience - it is now the time that we should establish a military research institute. Let it be called the Institucion Chilena de Investigacion Avanzada: the Chilean Institute for Advanced Research."
 CHL_mechanized:0 "Mechanized Effort"

 CHL_artillery:0 "Artillery Effort"

 CHL_support:0 "Support Effort"
 CHL_support_desc:0 "Infantry alone is ineffective. Not only does infantry require ordinance support but logistical, reconnaissance and specialist support. We should not allow these elements of our army to lag behind."
 CHL_rockets:0 "Rocketry"
 CHL_rockets_desc:0 "Our researchers have come to us with an interesting proposition: rockets. They say that the future of artillery lies in their exploitation. Certainly, we are not the type to turn down an opportunity for an even more effective way of bombarding our foes. We should investigate these rockets and see if they are worthwhile."

 CHL_nationalise_all_desc:0 "For too long have the bourgeois grown fat off the labour of the common man. No longer shall we tolerate indolent overseers and tyrannical taskmasters.

 CHL_communist_faction:0 "Found the Communist Latin Union"
 CHL_communist_faction_desc:0 "The Comintern makes a mockery of true communism - they are not even socialists. Stalin is no more than a despotic tsar ruling through fear. We should found our own faction of truly communist states and propagate our own revolution."

 CHL_communist_bolivia_paraguay_war:0 "Spread the Revolution North"

 CHL_join_allies:0 "Join the Allies"
 CHL_join_allies_desc:0 "Alone Chile is vulnerable to external powers greater than herself. We must find Allies to help defend ourselves against those who would seek to tear down our democracy and we must reciprocate in ensuring that liberty everywhere is protected."
 CHL_trade_deals:0 "Trade Deals"
 CHL_trade_deals_desc:0 "Chile is too closely linked with Germany and the other fascist ilk for prosperity. We should pursue new trade opportunities with the other democracies of the world."

 CHL_patriotic_leagues_desc:0 "The Patriotic Leagues were a paramilitary organisation which ensured the nationalist spirit of Chile was never quashed, however, they dissolved some ten years since. We should re-establish this honourable organisation and encourage it."
 CHL_ban_communism:0 "Ban Communism"

 CHL_establish_the_airforce_desc:0 "Linea Aerea Nacional was established in 1932 under Carlos Ibáñez del Campo but, as yet, it is only a small fleet. The skies will prove a necessary battlefield and, as such, aircraft a necessary investment. Our military industrial complex cannot facilitate an enormous air force so we should focus on making the best use of what we have."
 CHL_bomber_focus:0 "Bomber Focus"
 CHL_bomber_focus_desc:0 "We should focus or aviation efforts on bombers as they are versatile and have a strong payload."
 CHL_cas_focus:0 "Support Focus"

 CHL_fighter:0 "Fighters"

 CHL_naval_fighter_focus:0 "Naval Fighter Focus"
