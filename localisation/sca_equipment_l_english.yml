 DEN_light_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "Denmark bought this tank off of Italy in 1928 for evaluation purposes. Mechanical problems combined with the Danish Army's inability to figure out how to correctly drive the tank led to it becoming a target for shooting practice. Had it been put into service, it would have had 16mm of armour and been armed with two Madsen Machine guns."

 DEN_light_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "The FP-5 was a modified Carden-Loyd Patrol Car MK VI that Denmark had bought and re-fittd with Madsen machine guns. The tank had trouble in rough terrain and was hard to control, but it was cheap so the Danish Army ordered two to be re-fitted in Denmark. The tanks arrived in poor condition and Vickers had to send people to repair the tanks several times during their service."

 DEN_medium_tank_equipment_1_short:0 "Crusader"
 DEN_medium_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Crusader was a primary British cruiser tank built between 1941 and 1942. The tank suffered from various mechanical problems throughout its production lifespan and underwent many reconfigurations. While it performed admirably at the Battle of El Alamein, the Crusader proved too unreliable and would largely replaced by the American supplied M3 Grant and M4 Sherman. The final version of the Crusader, the Crusader III, had a QF 6pdr(57mm) cannon, 51mm of armour, and a top-speed of 26mph(42km/h)."
 DEN_medium_tank_equipment_2:0 "M4A3 Sherman"
 DEN_medium_tank_equipment_2_short:0 "Sherman"
 DEN_medium_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "The American made series of Sherman tanks remain one of the most iconic tanks of the war. Built as an all-around tank, the Sherman was a very capable tank in the hands of a good crew. After the war, the US gifted Denmark with eight Shermans in 1952. The Shermans given to the Danes were M4A3(105)VVSS tanks with a M1A1 76.2mm gun."
 DEN_medium_tank_equipment_3:0 "A34 Comet"
 DEN_medium_tank_equipment_3_short:0 "Comet"
 DEN_medium_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "The Comet was one of the best British tanks of WW2 and the last in the Cruiser line of tanks. It is well known for being the British tank that could not only stand up to German Panthers, but beat them reliably one on one. The Comet, like many British tanks, was fast, with a max speed of 32mph(51kmh). It had 1.3-4in (32-102mm) thick armour and a powerful 77mm HV turret supported by two 7.92mm Besa MGS."
 DEN_modern_tank_equipment_1:0 "Centurion"
 DEN_modern_tank_equipment_1_short:0 "Centurion"
 DEN_modern_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "Originally designed to be a heavy cruiser, the Centurion ended up becoming Britain's first main-battle tank. The Centurion was widely succesfull and became one of the most widely used tank designs, with some modified versions still in service today. Armed with a 105mm L7 Rifled Gun and a .30 cal Browning MG, a top speed of 22mph(35km/h), and armoured with 52mm-152mm of armour, the Centurion was a powerful tool on the battlefield. Several were given to the Danish as gifts by the Americans and the British."
 
 DEN_heavy_tank_equipment_1:0 "Char B1"
 DEN_heavy_tank_equipment_1_short:0 "Char B1"
 DEN_heavy_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Char B1 was a French heavy tank built between 1921 and 1934. It was unique in that it had two main guns, a 47mm rotating turret and a 75mm mounted turret in the front. The tank was heavily armoured, with the upgraded Char B1 'bis' having 60mm of armour, but it was slow and very fuel hungry. The char B1 is legendary for its exploits in the Battle of France where even a single Char B1 could hold off entire German battalions. In one instance, a single Char B1 took out 13 Panzer III's and Panzer IV's and left relatively unscathed despite having been hit over 140 times."
 DEN_heavy_tank_equipment_2:0 "Char B 40"
 DEN_heavy_tank_equipment_2_short:0 "Char B 40"
 DEN_heavy_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Char B40 was being designed when the Battle of France broke out, meaning that not even a prototype was ever built. Had it been built, the Char B40 would have been the successor to the Char B1, but with more armour and a better engine. Like its predecessor, the Char B40 was planned to have two turrets rather than the standard one, with a 47mm rotating top turret and a 105mm front turret."
 DEN_heavy_tank_equipment_3:0 "ARL 44"
 DEN_heavy_tank_equipment_3_short:0 "ARL 44"
 DEN_heavy_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "The ARL 44 was a late war French heavy tank, designed to let France have a tank that could fight the Tiger II's and to keep its engineers up to date. Based on designs from before the Fall of France, the ARL 44 used many older parts, including the tracks of the Char B1. Not completed until after the war, the ARL 44 had 120mm of armour and a 90mm DCA45 main turret."
 DEN_heavy_tank_destroyer_equipment_3:0 "ARL 40"
 DEN_heavy_tank_destroyer_equipment_3_short:0 "ARL 40"
 DEN_heavy_tank_destroyer_equipment_3_desc:0 "Designed before the Battle of France, the ARL 40 would have been a massive self-proppelled assault gun, with a 75mm high velocity APX gun and a muzzle velocity between 400m/s and 600 m/s depending on the munition fired."
 
 DEN_super_heavy_tank_equipment_1:0 "FCM F1"
 DEN_super_heavy_tank_equipment_1_short:0 "FCM F1"
 DEN_super_heavy_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "The FCM F1 was a planned super heavy tank in France, although only a wooden mock-up was finished before France fell. The FCM F1 was designed to replace the aged Char 2C, the only Super-Heavy tank ever actually suceesfully completed and produced. Like the Char B1, the FCM F1 was planned to have two turrets, a main 90mm DCA gun and a secondary 47mm SA37 gun. With 100mm of armour, the FMC F1 would have been a true behemoth, especially in 1940 or 1941 where it would have had no equal."
