 NOR_kvinnehirden:0 "The Valkyries"
 NOR_kvinnehirden_desc:0 "The kvinnehirden, our female counterparts of the Hird, have long stood besides us in sanitation brigades. The history of Viking women has created pressure to allow the formation of "Valkyrie" brigades of female volunteers, in emulation of our ancestors.

 NOR_mobilize_3:0 "Special Forces Integration"
 NOR_mobilize_3_desc:0 "With our military becoming top-of-the-line, we need to start thinking about more advanced stratagems, some of which would likely include our special forces.

 NOR_full_train:0 "Revise Training Regime"
 NOR_full_train_desc:0 "For the last couple of decades we have reduced the amount of training recruits recieve to historically low amounts. This has made their training efficient monetarily, but with war looming we are beginning to realize that perhaps this was not the best system.

 NOR_central_af_desc:0 "As time marches on so too does the military. Until now our Air Forces have been split amongst the Army and the Navy, but recent events have proven that if we wish to most effectively utilize our air forces than they should be made into their own service, equivalent to that of the Army and Navy, not subservant."
 NOR_heavy_water:0 "Expand Vemork"

 NOR_rehabilitate_navy_desc:0 "The Royal Norwegian Navy has long been a source of pride for our country, respectably keeping our neutrality assured in the Great War.

 NOR_heavy_battleships:0 "Leviathons"

 NOR_king:0 "Deal With the King"
 NOR_king_desc:0 "We are currently in a unique position. Although the people largely support us, they are also extremey fond of, and proud of our king. Having a king goes against all of our policies, but trying to sideline or remove the king could seriously erode our support."
 NOR_split_fin:0 "Split Finland"
 NOR_split_fin_desc:0 "We already know that the Soviet Union desires the Karelian territory, however we know that attacking Finland is not as simple as it first appears. In exchange for our help, the Soviets would surely split the spoils of war?"

 SWE_inernational_com:0 "The International State"
 SWE_inernational_com_desc:0 "Sweden may be a country, but does that truly mean that it is seperate from other countries? We should focus on the ideals of the people as a whole, not on Sweden as an entity unto itself."
 SWE_trade_uk:0 "Trade With Britain"
 SWE_trade_uk_desc:0 "Britain has long been a strong trading partner of ours. We should ensure that it stays that way, even as tensions continue to build."
 SWE_trade_ger:0 "Trade With Germany"
 SWE_trade_ger_desc:0 "Our trade with Germany is extremely important. Their power and proximity to ourselves has not gone unnoticed, and we should ensure that we remain on their good side."
 SWE_permittenttrafiken:0 "Permittenttrafiken"
 SWE_permittenttrafiken_desc:0 "Germany has requested that we give them access through our lands so as to better prepare an assault against their enemies from the north. While we are wary of this, they have promised to not transport weapons or goods, only soldiers."
 SWE_look_sov:0 "Diplomatic Soviet Ties"
 SWE_look_sov_desc:0 "Although we recognized the Soviet Union in 1924, we have not really established any strong Soviet ties, largely due to lingering anti-russian sentiment. We should fix this."
 SWE_ally_trade:0 "Allied Trade"
 SWE_ally_trade_desc:0 "Although we cannot directly help the allies, that does not mean that we cannot cut them some favorable trade deals. Preferably in a way that won't attract too much German attention."
 SWE_league:0 "Reform the League of Armed Neutrality"
 SWE_league_desc:0 "Twice in the past we have very successfully participated in the Leagues of Armed Neutrality, preventing other countries from taking advantage of us. With things the way they are, perhaps it would be better for us neutrals to stand together."
 SWE_one_neutral:0 "Non-binding Agreements"
 SWE_one_neutral_desc:0 "Although we understand that other countries may have a harder time mantaining their neutrality, but unfortunately we cannot commit any serious forces to any defence but our own."
 SWE_invite_baltic:0 "Invite the Baltic States"
 SWE_invite_baltic_desc:0 "Once a part of the Swedish Empire, the baltic states are currently enjoying their independance. However they are small and weak, and their neutrality as well as their independance will be hard to keep without outside help. Perhaps they are willing to join our league?"
 SWE_invite_lowlands:0 "Invite the Lowland Countries"
 SWE_invite_lowlands_desc:0 "Located in a precarious situation, the countries of the lowlands stand directly in between Germany and France. Rather than risk being overrun like in the Great War, maybe they are willing to join us for mutual protection?"
 SWE_invite_sca:0 "Invite Scandinavia"
 SWE_invite_sca_desc:0 "As a scandinavian country, we share close ties with our fellow scandinavian brethren. We share a lot of our history and culture together, perhaps they would be willing to share in our league as well?"
 SWE_join_allies:0 "Join the Allies"
 SWE_join_allies_desc:0 "Sweden can no longer stand by and pretend that the atrocities committed by the Reich are not our problem. We should make all do haste to end this hateful regime once and for all!"
 SWE_join_axis:0 "Join the Axis"
 SWE_join_axis_desc:0 "Germany has long been a close trading partner and diplomatic ally. With a New Europe dawning, we cannot be left behind. We should join Germany in their endeavors, securing our place in the future."
 SWE_soviet_base:0 "Soviet Basing Rights"
 SWE_soviet_base_desc:0 "For years our animosity towards Russia and the Soviet Union has caused us to deny them as much access to the Baltic Sea as possible. However the times are changing along with the winds, and offering the Soviets more control over the Baltic along with basing rights should go a long way towards repairing our relations."
 SWE_expand_home:0 "Expand the Home Guard"
 SWE_expand_home_desc:0 "We already have in place a system of volunteer militias who are ready to join the fight at a moment's notice. We can expand upon this system, making it an official part of the Swedish Army, increasing its efficiency and preparedness level."
 SWE_radical_reform:0 "Worker Primacy"
 SWE_radical_reform_desc:0 "The workers are the backbone of this country, and as such we need to make sure that they are taken care of. No longer shall the workers fall through the holes in the safety nets."
 SWE_moderate_reform:0 "Social Protections"
 SWE_moderate_reform_desc:0 "Upon review of our social policies we have found problems with our current system. Too often those at the very bottom suffer from the very programs designed to help them. We should reform these systems so as to better serve their needs."
 SWE_expand_lotta:0 "Expand the Lottorna"
 SWE_expand_lotta_desc:0 "The Women's Volunteer Defence Service (Lottorna) was created in 1924, inspired by a similar Finnish organization. Here women are able to help the war effort by doing many of the things that soldiers are too busy fighting to do, including making clothing and servicing the sick. Some even train with weapons in case of emergencies! This organization is worthy of our attention, and its expansion."
 SWE_fighting_women:0 "Mobilize the Lottorna"
 SWE_fighting_women_desc:0 "As war drags on we begin to require more men to fight. However, we are beginning to run short of even those barely considered men. Luckily, we have a group of people already used to war, with many of them already familiar with weaponry! Although unorthodox, and certainly at the detriment of the organization's main objectives, we find that we have little choice but to militarize and mobilize the Lottorna as a full fighting force!"
 SWE_building_tech:0 "New Building Techniques"
 SWE_building_tech_desc:0 "Time stops for no-one, and least so in the case of technology. If we wish to stay competitive, we must ensure our technological competativeness."
 SWE_end_neutral:0 "End Policy of Neutrality"
 SWE_end_neutral_desc:0 "The time has come for us to throw off the yoke of neutrality, no longer shall we be held back by our own misguided views of how to ensure peace. For some things can only be wraught at the end of the sword or by the barrel of a gun."
 SWE_guarantees:0 "Guarantee of Rights"
 SWE_guarantees_desc:0 "The people must be respected, and their civil liberties should not be breached. If we wish to make sure that the people understand this, we must not only pay lip service, but enshrine rights in law."
 SWE_military_trade:0 "Increase Military Trade"
 SWE_military_trade_desc:0 "War comes to Europe, we can see it. If we wish to be prepared for this eventuality, then we must make sure that as a nation we are prepared for Europe to once again erupt into flames."
 SWE_infr:0 "Increase Infrastructure Spending"
 SWE_infr_desc:0 "Infrastructure is the literal building block of any country. If we wish to remain a viable and competative force, we must make sure that our infrastructure is up to scratch."
 SWE_ger_coop:0 "German Cooperation"
 SWE_ger_coop_desc:0 "Now that we have a formal alliance with Germany, we should do all in our power to ensure our close collabration in both military and technological matters."
 SWE_ally_tech:0 "SWE_ally_tech"
 SWE_ally_coop:0 "Allied Cooperation"
 SWE_ally_coop_desc:0 "The allies have at their disposal many advanced technologies and military tactics. Now that we can count ourselves among their number, we can also benefit from this collaberation of great minds."
 SWE_expand_stock:0 "Expand Stockholm College"
 SWE_expand_stock_desc:0 "Stockholm College may be a top tier school in Sweden, but it lacks the international accredidation that even some of our fellow Scandinavian colleges and universities have. By expanding the college, we can increase its appeal, make it more productive, and perhaps even make plans for it to eventually become a university!"
 SWE_expanded_mil:0 "Expanded Military Production"
 SWE_expanded_mil_desc:0 "Our miltary production needs to be ramped up if we ever want any hope of ever defending ourselves from those who would do us harm."
 SWE_exp_civ:0 "Expand Heavy Industry"
 SWE_exp_civ_desc:0 "Even in times of great desperation we cannot afford to let our non-military industry fall behind."
 SWE_expand_mines:0 "Expand the Mines"
 SWE_expand_mines_desc:0 "The iron mines of Sweden are world famous. We recieve orders for our iron from all over the world, and our quality is some of the highest. In addition we also produce good quality Tungsten, which is both rare and valuable. If we are to meet not only our own needs, but that of our customers, we need to expand our mining operations to their limit!"
 SWE_tungsten:0 "Expand Tungsten Production"
 SWE_tungsten_desc:0 "Sweden may not have the world's largest supply of Tungsten in the world, but we certainly do have more than most countries. If we are to capitalize on this rare metal, we need to expand our tungsten production to the highest levels possible!"
 SWE_expand_rail:0 "Expand the Rail Lines"
 SWE_expand_rail_desc:0 "Now that we have increased our mining production, we should also make sure that we can transport our goods to their destinations. More production is useless if we cannot move the extra supply!"
 SWE_defence:0 "Försvarsbeslut"
 SWE_defence_desc:0 "Every five years the military is reviewed before being given instructions on organization and focus in a "Defence Resolution" or "Försvarsbeslut". These resolutions can be used to plan the future of the Swedish military."
 SWE_army_ops:0 "Army Operations Staff"
 SWE_army_ops_desc:0 "Upon reviewing our armed forces, it has become abundently clear that our army is woefully disorganized by modern standards. If we wish to create an effective and modern military we must increase our communication and organization."
 SWE_tank_acquisition:0 "Tank Acquisition"
 SWE_tank_acquisition_desc:0 "Building a tank force is paramount for surviving in a modern war. At current we only possess a handful of old, outdated models. We cannot allow the current situation to remain as is."
 SWE_modern_cav:0 "A Modern Cavalry"
 SWE_modern_cav_desc:0 "Gone are the days of men on horseback riding in to save the day. Instead their will be men riding in metal beasts to the rescue. We need to make sure that this transition happens both quickly and smoothly."
 SWE_secret_ops:0 "Special Operations Staffs"
 SWE_secret_ops_desc:0 "If we are to have a modern army, then we must create departments solely dedicated to such things as Military Intelligence, Cryptography and Photography."
 SWE_air_defence:0 "Air Force Operations Staff"
 SWE_air_defence_desc:0 "The Air Force is too important to be a simple part of another military group. Instead the air force should be organized into its own distinct department, that can take care of all of its own unique needs."
 SWE_anti_air_focus:0 "Air Defence Staff"
 SWE_anti_air_focus_desc:0 "Air warfare has become a major part of war. Defending our territory from bombers and deterring scouts has become a top priority. We cannot entrust this task to an already existing department as they already have their own things to worry about. Instead we should create an anti-air defence department that deals entirely with our enemy's aircraft."
 SWE_navy_staff:0 "Navy Operations Staff"
 SWE_navy_staff_desc:0 "Our navy is one of our nation's greatest pride's and joy's. However its current organizational structure is old and outmoded. A simple restructuring should fix most of its current innefficencies."
 SWE_end_king:0 "Dismantle the Monarchy"
 SWE_end_king_desc:0 "That our country still has a monarchy is an insult to the people. Even more that the "King alone shall govern the realm" remains a part of our constitution. As a communist state, we cannot allow this to stand."
 SWE_north:0 "Rulers of the Norse"
 SWE_north_desc:0 "As the most successful descendents of the Norse, we are also the ones with the greatest claim to inherit their land. All of them."
 SWE_const_reform:0 "Constitutional Reform"
 SWE_const_reform_desc:0 "Although efficient for what we do now, the Swedish constitution is outmoded and needs to be updated for the times. Although we cannot do it immediately, we should start looking into the possibility of rewriting our constitution so that it matches with the times."
 SWE_history:0 "War History Staff"
 SWE_history_desc:0 "The study of history can teach us much, especially when it comes to the matter of warfare. If we can establish a department for the sole purpose of researching and applying military history, it would greatly increase our country's fighting potential."
 SWE_lessons:0 "Lessons of War"
 SWE_lessons_desc:0 "War has a long and complicated history, full of important characters from across the world. Alexander the Great, Sun Tzu, Clausewitz, Nelson, Napoleon, all these and more have played a great part in our understanding of war. In reading and studying of military practices, we can now work on applying them to our modern day situation. For despite all of our advances, despite all of our advanced technology, war never changes."
 SWE_motor:0 "Army Motorization"
 SWE_motor_desc:0 "The swedish army is disgracefully far behind on modern motorization and mechanization. We should invest in making it so that our troops can be properly supported."
 SWE_crypto:0 "Cryptographical Advances"
 SWE_crypto_desc:0 "As a focal point between the germans and the british, we are in a unique position to listen in to both sides. In doing so we can advance our own cryptographical abilities, both for encryption and decryption."
 SWE_artillery:0 "Support Artillery"
 SWE_artillery_desc:0 "Artillery, Anti-Tank, Anti-Air. All these are required in the modern army if one wishes to stand a ghost of a chance against an opponent. We cannot fall behind now."
 SWE_combined_arms:0 "Combined Arms"
 SWE_combined_arms_desc:0 "A modern army is versatile, able to take on any threat. Should we get involved in any fighting, we need to be preapred to fight against any and all opponents, which means we need an army that has perfectly integrated every type of weaponry and tactics available."
 SWE_foreign_fighters:0 "Foreign Fighters"
 SWE_foreign_fighters_desc:0 "Sweden does not currently have the military capacity to produce its own fighters. Instead we need to turn to the world powers and see if any of them are willing to sell."
 SWE_domestic_fighters:0 "Domestic Fighters"
 SWE_domestic_fighters_desc:0 "Sweden can become reliant on foreign powers, we must develop our own fighters as soon as possible!"
 SWE_bomber_comp:0 "Bomber Competition"
 SWE_bomber_comp_desc:0 "Sweden cannot fall behind in its stock of bombers either. We should look into acquiring some."
 SWE_new_focus:0 "Secondary Air Focus"
 SWE_new_focus_desc:0 "Now that we have established production ideals for our fighters, it is time that we turned our attention to creating a second priority for our air forces. Should we focus on tactical bombing, strategic bombing, or some combination therein?"
 SWE_air_lessons:0 "Lessons of the Air"
 SWE_air_lessons_desc:0 "Having now seriously begun our acquisition of airplanes, we can finally begin to seriously look at effective strategems for using our newfound air force. This should prove most fruitful."
 SWE_amphibians:0 "Expand the Coastal Artillery Corps"
 SWE_amphibians_desc:0 "The Coastal Artillery Corps, or Kustartilleriet, is responsible for both protecting our shore from invasion, and for being the first boots on the ground in case we decide to send a naval invason. The KA are some of our toughest and most capable troops, it is time that we increased their size and funding."
 SWE_per_albin_line_1:0 "Coastal Per Albin Line"
 SWE_per_albin_line_1_desc:0 "Sweden cannot be allowed to be invaded by any of our enemies. In order to prevent this, we should create a lane of defence along the coast, preventing a naval assault."
 SWE_per_albin_line_2:0 "The Second Per Albin Line"
 SWE_per_albin_line_2_desc:0 "No plan is perfect, which is why one must always have a contingency plan in place. Should any attackers manage to get through our initial lines at the beaches, we must a have a secondary line ready to repel them from further advance into our country."
 SWE_def_focus:0 "Defensive Focus"
 SWE_def_focus_desc:0 "Sweden is not an aggressive nation, we do not launch attacks. We wait for the enemy to break themselves upon our lines instead."
 SWE_offensive_focus:0 "Offensive Focus"
 SWE_offensive_focus_desc:0 "No-one has ever successfully defended anything. If we wish to win a war, then we must rush the enemy with the force of a thousand storms, sweeping them before us."
 SWE_army_lessons:0 "Lessons From the Ground"
 SWE_army_lessons_desc:0 "Our study of army strategy has greatly increased our knowledge in that area. We are now prepared to adapt the newest and most worthy tactics and strategies!"
 SWE_interceptors:0 "Interceptor Technology"
 SWE_interceptors_desc:0 "Some of our scientists have come forward with a most interesting discovery, one that might forever change the nature of the sky. They claim to be able to make a plane travel several times faster than any current models. Their claims seem far-fetched, but our technicians tell us that their numbers seem correct. There can't be any harm in looking into this promising technology."
 SWE_convoy_protection:0 "Step-Up Convoy Protection"
 SWE_convoy_protection_desc:0 "Trade in the Baltic Sea is our lifeblood. Should the next war come, there will doubtless be attacks on our merchant vessels. As such we should expand as much effort as possible in building new ships that can protect our naval interests."
 SWE_dockyard:0 "Dockyard Expansion"
 SWE_dockyard_desc:0 "We cannot hope to create a powerful navy if we do not have the dockyards to build a navy at all. "
 SWE_dockyard2:0 "Shipbuilding Focus"
 SWE_dockyard2_desc:0 "Although we have expanded our dockyards to accomodate our need for a stronger navy, it is still not enough. If we wish to truly protect our shores then we must expand our fleet even more. And that requires more dockyards."
 SWE_screen:0 "Small Ship Building"
 SWE_screen_desc:0 "A navy does not consist of only large, powerful, ships. It also consists of small, powerful ships. We cannot forget this, and should invest in modern destroyers and light cruisers."
 SWE_heavy_ship:0 "Heavy Ship Building"
 SWE_heavy_ship_desc:0 "Large ships are things to be feared. Bristling with guns and ready to destroy all those who would dare oppose them. Our navy could use more of them."
 SWE_mil_fac:0 "Expand Military Industrial Capacity"
 SWE_mil_fac_desc:0 "Our guns need bullets to fire them, our planes need wings to fly, and our tanks need motors to drive. None of these things are created by magic, but by men in factories. We have men, we should give them factories."
 SWE_sub_focus:0 "Submersed Warfare"
 SWE_sub_focus_desc:0 "Not all of the fighting on the high seas has to take place above the sea. Below it lurks the submarines, waiting to destroy their much larger prey. Good subs can take out a ship several times their size and sneak away before anyone knows what hit them. We should invest in these deadly beasts of the deep."
 SWE_navy_lessons:0 "Lessons of the Sea"
 SWE_navy_lessons_desc:0 "As a scandinavian nation and as the descendants of the Norse, we have extensive knowledge and history of the sea. It is time that we finally compiled that knowledge and ensured it continuity. We can learn ten thousand lessons from the sea."
 SWE_navy_air:0 "Naval Air Power"
 SWE_navy_air_desc:0 "If we wish to truly control the seas, we cannot just focus on the seas themselves. We must also look to the skies. As large as ships may be, they are vulnerable to the payloads dropped by naval bombers."
 SWE_blitzkrieg:0 "Mobile Warfare"
 SWE_blitzkrieg_desc:0 "A modern army must strike quickly and without remorse. What better way than with tanks and other armored vehicles?"
 SWE_mass_assault:0 "Mass Assault"
 SWE_mass_assault_desc:0 "To win a war we must throw as more soldiers than the enemy can handle at any given location. We may not have the largest population, but by concentrating our infantry in strategic locations, we can break through their lines and force them to surrender!"
 SWE_superior_fire:0 "Superior Firepower"
 SWE_superior_fire_desc:0 "The guns of Sweden are strong, backed by a long history of quality weaponry. We may not be able to outnumber the enemy, but we will certainly be able to outgun them!"
 SWE_grand_battle:0 "Grand Battleplan"
 SWE_grand_battle_desc:0 "War will not come to Sweden swiflty, protected as we are from immediate attack. We should take advantage of this and make plans for every possible contigency. Should the enemy come knocking, we will have been expecting him."
 SWE_fake_oil:0 "Alternative Fuels"
 SWE_fake_oil_desc:0 "When war strikes we are cut off from much of that which we take for granted. Chief among these are oil and rubber. If we are going to be missing these materials, perhaps we can find alternatives, for at least a little while?"
 SWE_coastal_defence:0 "Coastal Defence"
 SWE_coastal_defence_desc:0 "The defence of our coastline is critical to our nation's survival, we should make sure that our operations on this matter are not only up to scratch, but better than everyone else."
 SWE_secrets:0 "Military Secrets"
 SWE_secrets_desc:0 "Our excellent spy networks, decryption, and world-class scientists have really pulled through for us over the years. Now they stand once again before us, telling us that they have gathered through various methods the secrets of powerful weaponry. Unfortunately, our country can only support one project of this scale. We must choose so that work can begin as soon as possible."

Every man, woman, and child needs to be ready and willing to give their all for the country.

 FIN_rehabilitate_desc:0 "The red cause in our country has been shamed for many years now.

 FIN_sov_tech:0 "Soviet Technology"
