## Events ##
 ww2tree.1.t:0 "Red Friday"
 ww2tree.1.d:0 "It was a rather normal day on the streets of [Root.Capital.GetName], or at least for [Root.GetAdjective] circumstances. The [Root.GetCommunistParty] was experiencing a large growth in the past weeks, with strikes and brawls being a daily occurrence. Today, however, it came to a terrible incident.\n\nMultiple union leaders called up once again for a country-wide strike and several hundred, if not thousands, of workers, communists and the like marched through the streets of [Root.Capital.GetName]. However, when they reached the traffic junction of the city, they were welcomed by a battalion of soldiers. When they were requested to stop and go back to their jobs, some followed the order however, the majority stayed and wanted to continue the strike and even some anarchists and radical socialists even threw stones at them. In reply, the commander in charge ordered his men to fire at the crowd.\n\nWhat followed was panic along with numerous brawls and gunfights, with some resisting late into the evening. In the following days, many left journals condemned this as an “Unjustified and coward attack on the workers and freedom-loving people of this nation.“ Long story short, we haven't really contributed to the stabilization of the situation."
 ww2tree.1.a:0 "As if it wasn't bad enough already."
 ww2tree.2.t:0 "Countrywide Acts of Sabotage"
 ww2tree.2.desc:0 "It was a quiet and nice morning. [Root.GetLeader] just woke up and dressed for the coming day, as suddenly an explosion interrupted his daily routine. He rushed to a window and couldn't believe what his eyes saw: A giant smoke cloud rose into the sky at the industrial district of the capital. The explosion was soon followed by the sirens of the approaching firefighters, who try to save as much as possible. Moments later, reports reached [Root.GetLeader], telling about numerous bomb blasts on several factories across the entire nation."
 ww2tree.2.a:0 "Great, my day is already ruined before it even started."
 ww2tree.3.t:0 "The March on [From.Capital.GetName]"
 ww2tree.3.d:0 "It was already evening when dozens or even hundreds of members of the [Root.GetCommunistParty] in the nation called up for a march on several government buildings.\n\nIt was obvious that their main target were not some town halls in the countryside, but [Root.Capital.GetName], where quickly a massive crowd of thousands of communists, socialists, unionists and workers formed and occupied several important buildings. Their main goal, however, was the seat of the [Root.GetAdjective] government itself, and so the crowd got moving, determined to overthrow the current and corrupt rule of [Root.GetLeader]. On their way, they encountered a few misguided loyalists, who still seemed to prefer their current government over our just and fair cause. Needless to say, they were quickly overwhelmed.\n\nWhen the crowd finally reached its destination, they were welcomed by a few desperated loyalists and hasty constructed defenses, with [Root.GetLeader] himself at the top. Because several of our attempts to solve the situation peacefully failed, fighting eventually started around midnight. The gunfights were heavy and desperate, but after an hour the last defenders outside the building were either captured or dead.\n\nInside, the remaining loyalists fiercely tried to stop us, with near to know prisoners being made. In the end, our brave revolutionaries finally came to [Root.GetLeader] and his ministers, with most of them being lynched by the furious attackers. When the next morning dawned, the old government was no more and the red flag proudly waved over [Root.GetCapital]."
 ww2tree.3.a:0 "Time for some real changes."
 ww2tree.4.t:0 "Unforseen Side Effects"
 ww2tree.4.d:0 "Shocking news reached us today: Several anti-communist militaries have deserted or, even worse, are now open rebelling against our new regime. And if it wasn't already bad enough, many officials have stopped working and multiple high-ranking popular politicians are openly defaming us, stating that we are a “Corrupt, despotic and totalitarian regime, that violently overthrew our old government for the sake of their own lust for power, which they covered in the quest for equality.“\n\nWith having a large part of the military and the population against us, quick action is required or we will end like our old rulers."
 ww2tree.4.a:0 "Traitors! All of them!"
 ww2tree.5.t:0 "The Completed Five Year Plan"
 ww2tree.5.d:0 "Excellent news! This morning, our first five-year plan has been completed, with the results being already broadcasted across the entire nation.\n\n“Attention Comrades! We have excellent news for you! We have won the battle on the production front. The following concluding official results show nothing, but that the standard of living has been increased in the past years by more then 20%! What follows are some numbers:\n- The food production has increased by 28%\n- The textiles production has increased by 19%\n- The space for living has increased by 18%\n- The furniture has increased by 23%\n- The fuel production has increased by 17%\n- The automobile production has increased by 16%, so you all will soon be able to afford your own personal cars!\n- The ship production has increased by 22%\n- The plane production has increased by 24%\n- The gun production has increased by an astonishing 33%\n\nThese are just some of the most important numbers. We are slowly recovering from the capitalists that have oppressed us for so long, but to achieve our utopia, we can't stop now. Most pleased by the results, [Root.GetLeader] has announced the start of a second five-year plan in the very moment you hear this, comrades! Long live [Root.GetNameDef]! Lobg live [Root.GetLeader]!“\n\nIn the following days, the ministry for public elucidation was able to report country-wide demonstrations by countless workers who wanted to thank [Root.GetLeader]."

 ww2tree.12.d:0 "[ROOT.GetLeader] spoke today, on the radio, a broadcast heard across the nation, even by the rather poor commoners.\n\n\"My fellow countrymen. We step into a new era, an era which will be full of changes and I know, that you are worried about it. But I can promise you: We will get through this as a nation, as a people. Don't listen to those traitorous communists or these weak liberals. All they want is to topple our great government, thus casting our beloved nation with their inefficient and corrupted way of ruling into destabilization and chaos. This can not be, and I and won't let that happen! But I can not do it all by myself. I will need your support to accomplish this genuine goal. Only together, we will stand strong as a nation and survive these turbulent times. Every single one of you must do his part. Be it in the factories, in our honorable military or even as a simple housewife and mother. Together, we can restore [Root.GetNameDef] to its former glory! Together, we will stand firm against the coming storm with me on your head! For [Root.GetNameDef]!\"\n\nIn the following days, the secret police started large scale raids against communist and democratic underground networks, and many ringleaders are now either dead or arrested. The Civilian casualty is minimal and the civilian awareness is none. Regrettably, the leader of the [Root.GetCommunistParty] escaped to one of our neighbors."
 ww2tree.12.a:0 "That is finally done."
 ww2tree.13.t:0 "No More Nobles"
 ww2tree.13.d:0 "The nobility of [Root.GetNameDef] had always more freedom of expression than the common folk, possessing the obscene amount of power they wrestled from previous governments. And after our new government took power, they simply assumed that they could keep their power and that everything would continue as usual. They constantly petitioned [ROOT.GetLeader] himself with requests of old rights and petty disputes, with some even having the nerve to unironically propose a noble council to 'advise' the government on the proper ways to guard our great nation.\n\nUnfortunately for them, [Root.GetLeader] was not a man known for leniency to those who annoy him. So he announced the creation of a noble council and invited every prominent noble within his territory to come to the first meeting, which happened to be, by pure chance, on the top floor of one of the capital building. That they really fell for this only shows once more, how much they were blinded by their sheer greed and lust for power. Anyways, when they arrived on time for the first 'council meeting', they only found a bullet in the back of their head, along with a quick descent downwards the windows of the room.\n\nThe falling corpses startled some passersby who were still on the streets at this late hours, but, needless to say, they will not be a problem anymore."

A big mob marched through the capital, chanting patriotic songs, as it made its way to the ghetto on the outskirts. There, a group of soldiers dressed like policemen opened the gate, which had been previously locked to stop the inhabitants from leaving their 'containment zone', and the men got in. It was a bloodbath. It didn't take long until the first houses were set ablaze, guns were fired and brawls were fought between the mob and the desperate and ravenous, yet brave, residents, which obviously stood no chance. At the end of the night, only three hours after the start of the attack, the ghetto fell once again silent. They were dead.\n\nThis night was but the start of something far greater. All across [Root.GetNameDef], countless citizens were encouraged to rise up in mobs and attack the minorities in their area. The government has made it once more clear: [Root.GetNameDef] was a country for [Root.GetAdjective]. ONLY [Root.GetAdjective]."

 ww2soviet.107.t:0 "Finland Refuses!"
 ww2soviet.107.d:0 "Finland foolishly refused our generous offer."
 ww2soviet.107.a:0 "Then war it is."
 ww2soviet.168.t:0 "Restoration of the Monarchy?"
 ww2soviet.168.d:0 "After hearing of the overturn of communism, Grand Duke Vladimir Kirillovich, the rightful heir to the Imperial throne, requests an immediate coronation as Tsar."

 ww2soviet.168.c:0 "No place for Monarchs in our new Russia."
 ww2soviet.174.t:0 "Russia Claims Alaska"
 ww2soviet.174.d:0 "The Russian government states that the territory of Alaska was unfairly aquire by the United States in 1876, and demands its immediate return. If we do not comply, they will surely try to take it by force."

 ww2soviet.196.t:0 "An Independent Turkestan"
 ww2soviet.196.d:0 "An independent Turkestan has been a hope of Turkic peoples in the steppes for many years. Perhaps this nationalistic sentiment can benefit us."
 ww2soviet.196.a:0 "Do it."
 ww2soviet.196.b:0 "Surely you're joking!"
 ww2soviet.197.t:0 "Finnish Neutrality"
 ww2soviet.197.d:0 "Ignoring the national security concern of having a potentially hostile state so close to its port in St. Petersburg, a neutral Finland makes for a springboard for a potential German invasion into Russia. Russia demands the return of Karelia and a government opposed to the fascist menace. In exchange Russia will guarentees Finlands continued independence."

 ww2soviet.200.a:0 "Good idea"
 ww2soviet.200.b:0 "That isn't neccessary. The cities will be a reminder of what must never occur again."
 ww2soviet.201.t:0 "The Communist Legacy"
 ww2soviet.201.d:0 "The threat of bolshevism will only cease when their memory is completely excised. We must give our cities their old names back."
 ww2soviet.201.a:0 "Pravoslávie, samoderzhávie, naródnost!"
 ww2soviet.202.t:0 "Operation Krokodil"
 ww2soviet.202.d:0 "We have reason to believe that Germany has developed an extrodinary new destroyer which would render our submarine fleet obsolete. We want your backing for a clandestine operation to hijack it and bring it back here."
 ww2soviet.202.a:0 "Go ahead."
 ww2soviet.202.b:0 "Its too much of a risk."
 ww2soviet.203.t:0 "Operation Successful... Kind of"
 ww2soviet.203.d:0 "Operation Krokadil failed to aquire the destroyer we were hoping for because our agents were discovered early on. But in the chaos of their attempted escape they did happen to commandeer... a battleship, and destroyed a small German fleet getting away. Unfortunately some of our brave heroes were left behind."

 ww2soviet.204.t:0 "They're back!"
 ww2soviet.204.d:0 "The men who we thought were lost in Operation Krokodil managed to find a plane and return! Fortuitously, the plane happened to be the private transport of none other than General Erwin Rommel. Our interrogators somehow convinced him defect, but unfortunately, an unneccesarily harsh blow from one of our agents has him convinced that he is Lord of the Seven Seas."
 ww2soviet.204.a:0 "Well, that's.. something."
 ww2soviet.205.t:0 "Russia claims Manchuria"
 ww2soviet.205.d:0 "The Russian Empire demands the return of Manchuria, it might be best to accept their demands, as their military presence on the mainland is far greater than our own."
 ww2soviet.205.a:0 "It is the only thing we can do."
 ww2soviet.205.b:0 "Outrageous! We refuse."
 ww2soviet.206.t:0 "Japan refuses"
 ww2soviet.206.d:0 "Japan has refused to return our rightful territory. Should we respond with force?"
 ww2soviet.206.a:0 "Now is not the best time. But we will not forget their hubris."

 ww2soviet.209.t:0 "The First Election"
 ww2soviet.209.d:0 "The first general election for the position of prime minister has just taken place. Although the Communist Party almost unanimously supports Nikolai Bukharin, the unexpected return of Alexander Kerensky has made the election more contested than expected."

 ww2soviet.210.a:0 "Reinstate him as Field Marshal."
 ww2soviet.210.b:0 "Refuse."
