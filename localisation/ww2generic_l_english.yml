 ww2tree.12.d:0 "[ROOT.GetLeader] spoke today, on the radio, a broadcast heard across the nation, even by the rather poor commoners.\n\n\"My fellow countrymen. We step into a new era, an era which will be full of changes and I know, that you are worried about it. But I can promise you: We will get through this as a nation, as a people. Don't listen to those traitorous communists or these weak liberals. All they want is to topple our great government, thus casting our beloved nation with their inefficient and corrupted way of ruling into destabilization and chaos. This can not be, and I and won't let that happen! But I can not do it all by myself. I will need your support to accomplish this genuine goal. Only together, we will stand strong as a nation and survive these turbulent times. Every single one of you must do his part. Be it in the factories, in our honorable military or even as a simple housewife and mother. Together, we can restore [Root.GetNameDef] to its former glory! Together, we will stand firm against the coming storm with me on your head! For [Root.GetNameDef]!\"\n\nIn the following days, the secret police started large scale raids against communist and democratic underground networks, and many ringleaders are now either dead or arrested. The Civilian casualty is minimal and the civilian awareness is none. Regrettably, the leader of the [Root.GetCommunistParty] escaped to one of our neighbors."
 ww2tree.12.a:0 "That is finally done."
 ww2tree.13.t:0 "No More Nobles"
 ww2tree.13.d:0 "The nobility of [Root.GetNameDef] had always more freedom of expression than the common folk, possessing the obscene amount of power they wrestled from previous governments. And after our new government took power, they simply assumed that they could keep their power and that everything would continue as usual. They constantly petitioned [ROOT.GetLeader] himself with requests of old rights and petty disputes, with some even having the nerve to unironically propose a noble council to 'advise' the government on the proper ways to guard our great nation.\n\nUnfortunately for them, [Root.GetLeader] was not a man known for leniency to those who annoy him. So he announced the creation of a noble council and invited every prominent noble within his territory to come to the first meeting, which happened to be, by pure chance, on the top floor of one of the capital building. That they really fell for this only shows once more, how much they were blinded by their sheer greed and lust for power. Anyways, when they arrived on time for the first 'council meeting', they only found a bullet in the back of their head, along with a quick descent downwards the windows of the room.\n\nThe falling corpses startled some passersby who were still on the streets at this late hours, but, needless to say, they will not be a problem anymore."

A big mob marched through the capital, chanting patriotic songs, as it made its way to the ghetto on the outskirts. There, a group of soldiers dressed like policemen opened the gate, which had been previously locked to stop the inhabitants from leaving their 'containment zone', and the men got in. It was a bloodbath. It didn't take long until the first houses were set ablaze, guns were fired and brawls were fought between the mob and the desperate and ravenous, yet brave, residents, which obviously stood no chance. At the end of the night, only three hours after the start of the attack, the ghetto fell once again silent. They were dead.\n\nThis night was but the start of something far greater. All across [Root.GetNameDef], countless citizens were encouraged to rise up in mobs and attack the minorities in their area. The government has made it once more clear: [Root.GetNameDef] was a country for [Root.GetAdjective]. ONLY [Root.GetAdjective]."
