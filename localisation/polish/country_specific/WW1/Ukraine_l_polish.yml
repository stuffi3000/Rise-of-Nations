 ww1_ukraine.1.t:0 "Ukranian Republic Falls From Power"
 ww1_ukraine.1.d:0 "On April 28th following the dispersal of the Central Council of the Ukrainian People's Republic the Ukraine was turned into a provisional dictatorship under the leader of Pavlo Skoropadsky who had claimed the title 'Hetman of Ukraine' hence the state of the Ukraine could be referred to as the Ukrainian Hetmanate the Ukrainian State. The coup had been sanctioned and agreed upon by the German Empire itself which was dissatisfied by the inefficiency of the Republican government to deliver the promised and much needed grain supplies to the starving German Army. Skoropadsky that same day was Christ mated by the church and became the Hetman of Ukraine. Many Ukrainian nationalists accused Skoropadsky of being a German collaborator who was supported by wealthy landowners. He was considered too Pro-Russian and dictatorial. However despite this his government was very efficient, organized, and built many schools and universities as well as create a temporary peace with the USSR."

 ww1_ukraine.2.d:0 "The Polish-Ukrainian War started on the 1st of November 1918 lasting to the 17th of July the following year over the complicated issue of Galicia. Due to a complicated history in Galicia under the rule of the Habsburgs for many years, a national identity of Ukrainians was developed over time to counter Polish autonomy demands. After the de facto dissolution and collapse of the Austro-Hungarian government in October of 1918 two regiments consisting largely of Ukrop's in an effort to unite the West Ukrainian lands within the former Austro-Hungarian Empire took control of the cities of Lviv proclaiming it as their capital. The Polaks which had been a majority in the city were shocked to be in a Ukrainian state and eventually fighting began between Ukrainian and Polish forces mainly concentrated around the city of Lviv."

Most of Skoropadsky's troops joined with the Directory and Skoropadsky turned to some Russian officers fighting along with Denikin to form a small force but they were not able to face the Directory troops and once the Directory troops took Kiev they officially took full power overthrowing Skoropadsky's regime and re-establishing the Ukranian People's Republic."

It was aimed at creating a unified Ukranian state however the Act Zluky did little to unify the states bu rather acted as purely symbolic in that both governments still retained their own seperate armies, administrations, and government structure. The text of the unverisal made by the Directorate of the Ukranian People's Republic states "The territory of Ukraine, divided over the centuries, including Galicia, Bukovyna, Carpathian Ruthenia, and Dnieper Ukraine will now become a great united Ukraine. Dreams, for which the best sons of Ukraine fought and died for, have come true.". However in the end the Ukraine was never able to gain independence."
