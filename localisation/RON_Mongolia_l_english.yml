 MONGOLIA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In the following years through some violent power struggles, Soviet influence got ever stronger, and after the Bogd Khaan's death, the Mongolian People's Republic was proclaimed on November 26, 1924. The government took control of the Bogda Khan's seal after his death according to the 26 November 1924 Constitution of the Mongolian People's Republic. Threats from the East and the South are coming. Can the new country overcome all difficulties and move towards a better future?"
 MONGOLIA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "After conflict with Japan on the eastern border, Mongolia's fate has been closely linked with the Soviet Union. Even though China in the south was plagued by the arduous anti-Japanese war, it still did not forget its sovereignty over Kalkha, and the wheel of destiny began to turn again."
