We integrated too closely with the [USA.GetAdjective], and now the [USA.GetName] has made a motion along with several members of our own administration to turn over the regular running of our government to the [USA.GetName].

Our rebellion however consists of a rag-tag group of disaffected and a few foreign volunteers. If we wish to challenge the government, we will need to consolidate our forces and rally around a single figure. The question is, who should that figure be? We could likely invite the support of the famous Communist Marcus Garvey. Alternatively, Barduway-Jallah, the last King of the Nien dynasty of the Krahn has offered his services."

Now, Barclay stands virtually unapposed for re-election, with only former President King's Unit Whigs showing any opposition whatsoever. It is not unusual for us to meddle in elections, former President King himself held an election so fraudulent that even other countries called him out on it. We cannot be quite that blatant, but can we really risk an opposition party gaining any traction?"

Former President King has won a surprise victory, marshalling last minute support with a whirlwind campaign. Although King was himself once a True Whig, this marks the first time that the True Whigs have been out of power since 1878.

Sentiments in the country had certainly been swinging away from the coasts and towards the hinterlands as more and more people began arguing for greater hinterland representation, sparked by fiery speeches given by local chiefs and supportive pastors, but the government had assumed that it would never catch on among eligible voters.

Blindly we ignored these, and now former President King has managed to wrangle up enough discontents to pose a political threat. We could admit that the reign of True Whigs running unopposed has come to an end, and attempt to form a coalition government with King.

Many point to Thomas Faulkner, a reformist and leader of the now defunct Peoples' Party as another, local example of someone who pushed for this idea.

One such issue has arisen among certain members of the revolution, who argue that the oppression of the Americo-Liberian majority has irrevocably harmed the chances of the native tribal people ever getting ahead.

Not all are quite so magnanimous though as it turns out, we have discovered that a group of supposedly devoted officers have actually been running a profiteering ring, giving us a small number of weapons while keeping a majority for themselves to sell.

 DARK_lib.30.desc2:0 "The Civil War has drawn to a close, and we have begun redistributing the land that we took from those that stood in the way of the revolution. Some of the more radical of our allies have demanded that we take all of the land held by Americo-Liberals, but luckily they seem to remain in the minority along with a few grumbling Americo-Liberals who are jittery that we took land at all. Our new owners are not as experienced in managing as the Americo-Liberals, but hopefully by fostering close working realtions among both groups, we will be able to overcome our current financial difficulties." 
 DARK_lib.30.desc3:0 "The Civil War has drawn to a close, and our tribal allies have become furious at our refusal to redistribute the land of any of the Americo-Liberals.

Unfortunately for them, this only enraged much of the populace who have now turned violently against the fascists. It all came to a head when King Victor Emmanuel demanded that [ITA.GetNameDef] make peace. When [ITA.GetLeader] refused, Victor Emmanuel revoked his position of Prime Minister.

Although reportedly furious in private, Benito Mussolini, Il Duce, has agreed to step down and retire from public life. The fascists still currently retain control of the government, but Pietro Badoglio promises a new Italy that will not follow in the example of Mussolini. Only time will tell if he is correct."

Demonstrations had been held for weeks in the streets of the country demanding his removal, many of which were broken up by the infamous blackshirts. Last week, Victor Emmanuel III, King of Italy apparently made an ultimatum to the fascist government that told them to fix the current situation, or he would personally dismiss the government. Rather than give up power, the fascists instead seem bent on continuing their rule by force. King Victor Emmanuel III now leads the opposition to overthrow the fascists and restore democratic rule to Italy. Experts report that the King currently holds the advantage, but that the tenacity of the fascists should not be underestimated."
