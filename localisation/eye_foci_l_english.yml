 SWI_geistige:0 "Promote Geistige Landesverteidigung"
 SWI_geistige_desc:0 "In 1935, councilman Fritz Hauser began an examination of how to protect our country's spiritual independance from the fascists and communists. That examination has led to the proposal of Geistige Landesverteidigung, or Spiritual National Defence, which calls for freedom, democracy, self-determination, and balanced government. We should accept this proposal with all haste."
 SWI_helvetia:0 "Pro-Helvetia"
 SWI_helvetia_desc:0 "While the armed defence of the nation, together with the preparation and organisation of such defence, is exclusively a matter of the state – indeed its primary duty – we wish to leave the spiritual defence of the nation primarily in the hands of the citizen. The state should have the necessary means at its disposal, and retain the right to oversee the use of these means."

To teach is not to impose any theories, but to stimulate your thoughts and challenge your thinking."
 SWI_richtlinienbewegung:0 "Support the Richtlinienbewegung"
 SWI_richtlinienbewegung_desc:0 "The elites have ruined the country and with our economy crushed after the crash of 1929, have still not managed to fix our numerous problems. Now vultures from the extreme left and right circle us, preparing to sweep our country into their waiting wings! No more, we must form a new alliance, one dedicated to helping the people, but not at the cost of our freedom!"

 SWI_go_left:0 "A Jump to the Left"
 SWI_go_left_desc:0 "In 1935 the Social Democratic Party finally renounced its call for a dictatorship of the proletariet, and cut its final ties with true communism, but now, with renewed power, perhaps its time to begin rethinking some of those old ideals? After all, it's just a jump to the left, and if necessary, we can always take a step to the right."

 SWI_planning:0 "Advanced Planning"
 SWI_planning_desc:0 "We cannot rely on plans made up in the heat of the moment. We should set up pre-made agreements with our neighbors in case of attack from another nation. We must make these plans in complete secrecy, and ready ourselves for when one side breaks our peace."
 SWI_first_line:0 "The Line"
 SWI_first_line_desc:0 "Switzerland will not cede an inch of its territory to the greater aims of the fascists, nor be taken advantage of for straegic reasons by the French. We are our own people, and we will not allow an enemy to cross our border!"
 SWI_extended_army:0 "The Extended Army Position"
 SWI_extended_army_desc:0 "As great as our first line is, it is silly of us to not have a back-up line prepared in the eventuality of a breach. The enemy may breach the first line, but they shall never breach the second!"

 SWI_aa_desc:0 "Now that we have begun to actually invest into our Anti-Air defences, it is time that we fully implemented them. Our country shall not have its air space violated by any nation, anyone who does shall soon regret it!"
 SWI_redoubt:0 "The Réduit National"
 SWI_redoubt_desc:0 "Switzerland must never fall, and even if it should, we will make the enemy pay for every inch with fields of blood. As a last resort we should build a grand defence in the highest mountains for a final stand. We swiss will fight until the very bitter end!"

 SWI_renegotiate:0 "Renegotiate Trade Deals"
 SWI_renegotiate_desc:0 "Switzerland is in the unenviable position of being heavily reliant on imports for our food and raw goods. If this must be so then we should try and make sure that all of our trade deals are as fair as possible."
 SWI_railroads:0 "Expand Electric Railways"

 SWI_shadow_seize:0 "Seize Factories"
 SWI_shadow_seize_desc:0 "War has once again come to Europe, and we cannot allow companies to sell all of their weapons overseas, we need them for ourselves. For those who refuse to comply, we have a new management team all set up for them."

 SWI_chemical:0 "Graubünden Chemical Plant"
 SWI_chemical_desc:0 "With our increased understanding of the natural world, we have come across great discoveries on how to create substitute fuels that drastically decrease our need for oil imports. We must make sure that we can produce as much of these synthetic materials as possible, and luckily we have a spot ready for just a factory."
 SWI_fuel_ration:0 "Fuel Rationing"
 SWI_fuel_ration_desc:0 "All non-essential citizens are no longer allowed to drive, reserves of fuel must be horded, and heating must be done using wood whenever possible. We are entirely reliant on imports for oil, and we need to reserve what we have for essential purposes only whilst we look for alternatives."

 SWI_red_cross:0 "The Red Cross"

 SWI_corporatism_focus_desc:0 "Switzerland has become a miserable state, unable to care for its people. That weakness lies with the weakness of our government. It must be destroyed and replaced with a more structured body, one that can effectively deal with the needs of the people and the state."
 SWI_go_ita:0 "Italian Friendship"
 SWI_go_ita_desc:0 "Italy and Mussolini are an excellent example of a greatly successful Fascist state. Switzerland shares many cultural ties to Italy, we should take advantage of this."

 SWI_irredentism:0 "Swiss Irredentism"
 SWI_irredentism_desc:0 "In 1919 the people of Vorarlberg voted to join their brethren in union. However, the capitalists and our own weak leaders refused to allow it! This cannot stand, those people are our own! We shall take what is ours, and perhaps a little more to compensate for time lost!"

 SWI_new_mil_desc:0 "Our army has been restructured, our men have been prepped, and our economy redesigned to ready ourselves for offensive war. Now we stand with the other nations of the world. Switzerland shall do what it has not done for a millenium, we shall march to war!"

 SWI_join_allies_desc:0 "Historically we have been on very good terms with the French, even coming up with joint plans should our country ever be attacked. New situations in the world however have caused us to wonder if perhaps we would best be served in an official alliance with France."
 SWI_french_tech:0 "French Technological Cooperation"
 SWI_french_tech_desc:0 "The French did not win the Great War through pur luck. On their side were scientists and researchers. The British and French may have both developed tanks to cross the trenches, but the French were the ones whose design has become the template for so many tanks produced even now. By linking our scientists and theirs, we can protect ourselves from any future incursionss through superior technology."
 SWI_extend_maginot:0 "Swiss Maginot Extension"

 SWI_army:0 "Review the Military"
 SWI_army_desc:0 "War brews once again in Europe. During the Great War we managed to stay completely neutral, but that by no means ensures our neutrality in the coming war. We must inspect our troops, and ensure that they are ready for the fight come."

 SWI_end_con:0 "End Reliance on Militia System"
 SWI_end_con_desc:0 "Until now conscription has served our country well, but times have changed and that method will no longer work. Instead, we must work towards a more modern professional army.

 SWI_con_to_army:0 "Institute a Draft"
 SWI_con_to_army_desc:0 "In order for us to have a standing army, we must first have men to serve in that army. We already have people on record as ready to serve. Well, it is time for them to serve."
 SWI_improve_con:0 "Improved Militia Training"
 SWI_improve_con_desc:0 "The army relies implicitly on the militia, and we cannot allow them to be anything but the best. Training needs to cover every possible situation so that our men can fight in any situation at any time."

 SWI_focus_home_air_desc:0 "The Swiss air industry must be expanded! We cannot always rely on foreign models to defend our lands, instead we must develop our own models for defence. "
 SWI_focus_foreign_air:0 "Focus on License Production"
 SWI_focus_foreign_air_desc:0 "Switzerland simply lacks the industry to develop its own aircraft in any significan amount. We must focus on ensuring foreign airplane purchases and licenses!"
 SWI_defend_homeskies:0 "Air Defence Techniques"
 SWI_defend_homeskies_desc:0 "Switzerland can only spare so many aircraft. We cannot afford failure on the battlefield, so we must learn how to effectively fight in the sky, and defeat the enemy. Even when outnumbered."
 SWI_interceptors:0 "Interceptors"
 SWI_interceptors_desc:0 "With the knowledge of rockets, we have come to realize the power of an aircraft that can quickly take off and fight. That it cannot go very far is not of any concern to us, for their job will be to protect the Swiss homeland from those who would dare defile it."
 SWI_other_air:0 "Alternative Aircraft"
 SWI_other_air_desc:0 "Switzerland has focused very heavily on fighters, and for the most part this is good, but we cannot forget that other plane types do exist, and looking into them, even just to check for their weaknesses, may be wise."
 SWI_naval_doc:0 "Establish Naval Doctrine"
 SWI_naval_doc_desc:0 "With no access to the sea, or even any sizeable lakes, we have had no need to actually establish any sort of Naval doctrine. However, circumstances have now changed, and we must quickly work on that which we have forgotten."
 SWI_build_docks:0 "Create a Swiss Naval Industry"
 SWI_build_docks_desc:0 "Landlocked we may have been, but we now have access to the sea! We may not have any prior planning for this, but we should not waste this opportunity! We cannot gain experience at sea if we do not have the capacity to build ships in order to get ships onto that sea in the first place!"
 SWI_reform_flotilla:0 "Reform the Lake Flotilla"
 SWI_reform_flotilla_desc:0 "Up until this point, the entirety of Swiss naval thought involved only the use of brown-water boats to protect our lakes and rivers. Now everything has changed. and a naval Branch of our military has become a necessity. We must take what experienced crew members we have, and begin the creation of our own, oceongoing navy!"
 SWI_naval_catchup:0 "Foreign Naval Technology"
 SWI_naval_catchup_desc:0 "We cannot lie to ourselves, we have not prepared for the eventuality of actually having a coastline. We do not know how to build ships, and we certainly don't know how to build modern military vessels! Should we wish to compete navally, we will have to import some foreign talent and ideas, if just so we can sail on even sea levels!"
 SWI_expand_docks:0 "Expand the Dockyards"
 SWI_expand_docks_desc:0 "Now that we have created a naval industry for ourselves, the time has come for us to expand it dramatically, and bring forth the full power of Swiss engineering."
 SWI_fast_build_navy:0 "A Pressing Need for Ships"
 SWI_fast_build_navy_desc:0 "We have spent years without so much as a single naval idea, and only trade ideas for our maritime practices. We do not even have a past history of exploration by sea. Now, however, we have marched to the shore, and developed a navy of our own. We may have to play catch-up with the rest of the world, but we will be damned if we don't at the very least make a go at becoming a naval force to be reckoned with!"
 SWI_naval_air:0 "Naval Aircraft"
 SWI_naval_air_desc:0 "With a shoreline and sea access comes a concern we had not previosuly forseen. The need for planes that deal with airspace over the open waters. We must tackle this problem head on, and create planes that are up to this unique challenge!"

 SWI_support_friends:0 "Support Anti-Fascism"
 SWI_support_friends_desc:0 "Fascism is a morally repugnant ideology, suited only for the dredges of humanity. We must fight with every fiber of our beings. Anyone is better than a fascist, and we will support the fight as best we are able."
 SWI_anti_communism:0 "Support Anti-Communism"
 SWI_anti_communism_desc:0 "Communism, the opiate of the clueless masses who do not understand that which they preach. We cannot allow this dangerous ideology to spread any longer. We must support those who fight against this horrid ideology, at any cost."
 SWI_foreign_trade:0 "Foreign Trade Investment"
 SWI_foreign_trade_desc:0 "As a neutral country we can be trusted to handle many things. Trade transactions, banking, the Red Cross. We can use this to our advantage, play off enemies against one another, and secure the best trade deals possible for our country,"

 SWI_secret_wunderwaffe_desc:0 "Our scientists have come forth with news that it has become possible to wield the power of creation itself, the atom, in order to create a bomb the likes of which the world has never seen.

 AUS_dissolve_heimwehr:0 "Dissolve the Heimwehr"
 AUS_dissolve_heimwehr_desc:0 "For over a decade now the Heimwehr have stood as a powerful ally and paramilitary force. However, we have never been able to reconcile ourselves with their extreme measures and rhetoric, unbecoming of a truly Christian organization. In recent years the Heimwehr have become a shadow of their former selves, it is time that we finally rid ourselves of these extremists and replace them with true patriots!"
 AUS_unholy_alliance:0 "The Unholy Alliance"
 AUS_unholy_alliance_desc:0 "The Vaterländische Front has failed to gain traction with the common people,. and times have only gotten worse. Although their party has been banned, many prominent National Socialists still operate within our country. Perhaps we could entice some of them to join the government?"
 AUS_fascist_coup:0 "The Black Revolution"
 AUS_fascist_coup_desc:0 "The Vaterländische Front has proven weak and unable to deal with the problems dealing with Austria. This is only to be expected, Austria cannot survive on its own, deprived of its old lands by a vindictive Entente determined to keep the German people down! Now that it has been proven that Austria cannot stand alone, we must seize power to ensure that Austria fulfills its destiny as a part of a greater Germany!"
 AUS_join_germany:0 "German Unification"
 AUS_join_germany_desc:0 "For too long the German people have been kept seperate, apart. The German people are destined to rule, to be greater than all others. Now that we have taken power, we can finally take the next step towards that goal, and join Germany proper. May the Reich reign for a thousand years!"
 AUS_reform_conscription:0 "General Service Obligation Act"
 AUS_reform_conscription_desc:0 "Austria has for too long been hamstrung by the Treaty of St. Germain. Should we be attacked, we could not even defend ourselves effectively! The time has come to at least moderately increase our conscription, treaty or no treaty!"
 AUS_sturmkorps:0 "Form the Sturmkorps"
 AUS_sturmkorps_desc:0 "The German Schutzstaffel (SS) are the envy of the military world with their discipline, uniforms, and undying loyalty to Hitler. We too should create a similar organization of full time paramilitarists, loyal only to the government."
 AUS_foreign_protection:0 "Renew the Rome Protocols"
 AUS_abkommen:0 "Austro-German Abkommen"
 AUS_abkommen_desc:0 "The war in Abyssinia has ruined our immediate hopes for western protection. We see little choice but to deal directly with the Reich, signing a Decleration of Friendship and buying time."
 AUS_no_ger:0 "Choose Italy"
 AUS_no_ger_desc:0 "The war in Abyssinia has divided the western powers, and Italy now stands isolated. If we do not act now, they will find themselves forced to turn to Germany for aid. Britain will never help us, and France will never act without Britain. Italy serves as our only hope for protection against the Reich. They have already saved us once in 1934, perhaps they can do so again."
 AUS_hapsburgs:0 "Restore the Hapsburgs"
 AUS_hapsburgs_desc:0 "It has become clear to us that the West has abandoned us, and the remants of the Little Entente care nothing for us. Although we have revoked most of the Hapsburg Law, we have stopped short of putting Otto von Hapsburg on the throne out of fear of international reprisal. With international diplomacy essentially being moot, it is time to restore the Hapsburgs to the throne. "
 AUS_foreign_appeal:0 "Foreign Appeal"

 AUS_protect_cze:0 "Protect Czechoslovakia"
 AUS_protect_cze_desc:0 "Czechoslovakia has, since its independence, grown powerful and industrious, but their lands are eyed greedily by their neighbors. We will offer them our protection against these threats, either by welcoming them once again as an integral part of our Empire, or by granting them association status."

 AUS_tyrol_for_dalmatia_desc:0 "In the last war the Italians treachorously took from us the lands of South Tyrol, an integral part of our empire since time in memoriam! However, we know that the Italians were cheated out of their real prize, the Dalmatian coast. Should we promise Italy the coast, they may well return South Tyrol to us. "
 AUS_reclaim_venice:0 "Reclaim Venetia"

 AUS_reclaim_empire:0 "Reclaim the Empire"

 AUS_ally_italy:0 "Italian Alliance"
 AUS_ally_italy_desc:0 "We have made great strides in regards to our relationship with Italy. A marriage between our royal families should cement our friendship, and our mutual interests."
 AUS_ally_bul:0 "Bring in Bulgaria"
 AUS_ally_bul_desc:0 "Bulgaria has allied with us in the past, and they are no friends of the western powers who have taken much of their rightful land. With Italy by our side, they will surely see the light in joining us once again, but this time, to victory."
 AUS_dictatorship:0 "Cement Leadership"
 AUS_dictatorship_desc:0 "Our leadership over this country is strong, but lacks the bite you would expect from a truly authoritarian government. We must ensure that the people know not only that we are in charge, but that we are efficient and working for their benefit."
 AUS_stab_in_back:0 "Stabbed in the Back Mythos"
 AUS_stab_in_back_desc:0 "Austria may not be a stranger to defeat, but our defeat in the last war was unlike any previous defeat. The cause came not from the field of battle where our soldiers fought unceasingly, but from the Home Front, where nationalist uprisings caused by Entente propaganda tricked the people into going against their best interests."
 AUS_recovery:0 "Austrian Renewal"
 AUS_recovery_desc:0 "Austria cannot lose itself in what could of been, instead we must forge ahead and create the world in which we want to live."
 AUS_peasants:0 "Price Controlled Agriculture"
 AUS_peasants_desc:0 "The peasants have suffered long enough, we cannot allow ourselves to become complacent even as the worst of the Great Depression begins to lift. We must continue our policy of ensuring high prices for our agricultural products, or else the market will be flooded!"
 AUS_worker_benefits:0 "Worker Relief"
 AUS_worker_benefits_desc:0 "For the past several years we have rightly focused on the peasants, who produce the food of the nation. However, as the worst of the Great Depression falls, we must decide if the time has come to reverse course somewhat. The workers of our urban towns and cities have been faced with high unemployment and food prices, but perhaps we can help them find work and lower the price controls on our food supplies."
 AUS_reinforce_guilds:0 "Reinforce the Guilds"
 AUS_reinforce_guilds_desc:0 "As a part of our restructuring of the economy we reformed the Guild system from the days of old, tweaked to fit a modern, corporate system. We should enforce this policy to the best of our ability."
 AUS_keynes:0 "Keynesian Economics"
 AUS_keynes_desc:0 "In the past we have rejected the economic theories of Keynes as inflationary, with several of our leading businesses rejecting any attempt to use any part of the theories. However, we have noticed that our country has faltered economically, and perhaps radical change will be for the best. Many of those business leades have proven to be Nazi sympathizers anyway."
 AUS_corporatism_focus:0 "Instill the Corporations"
 AUS_corporatism_focus_desc:0 "When the constitution was rewritten in 1934, it provided for the establishment of seven corporate entities that were to represent the people. However, only two were ever established. We have been too busy with other matters in the past to address this, but we should do so now."
 AUS_hun_love:0 "Hungarian Connection"
 AUS_hun_love_desc:0 "Hungary has close ties to ourselves and Italy, as laid out in the Rome Protocols. Now that we have drawn closer to Italy, we should bring them in as well."
 AUS_ally_greece:0 "Greek Alliance"
 AUS_ally_greece_desc:0 "Although not Catholic like ourselves, Greece also stands as another fellow authoritarian state. We should bring them into the fold."
 AUS_democracy:0 "Socialist Collaboration"
 AUS_democracy_desc:0 "Although the Social Democratic Party has been banned and their paramilitias destroyed, they still remain an active underground force in our country, but one that opposes Germany. We can no longer afford to be so picky as to who our allies are, even if they are socialists."
 AUS_crackdown:0 "Suppress Underground Movements"
 AUS_crackdown_desc:0 "For too long we have allowed the remnants of various organizations peck away at our country, weakening it from within. No longer, we shall root them out, all of them."
 AUS_christian:0 "A Christian State"
 AUS_christian_desc:0 "Austria has long stood as a bulwark of Christianity, against the Turkish invasion we stood strong, and we lead the charge against the heretical protestants. We have created a corporate system as detailed in the Rerum Novarum, and once again stand ready to defend and spread Christendom."
 AUS_sudetenland:0 "Demand the Sudetenland"
 AUS_sudetenland_desc:0 "The Sudetenland has a large German population, and rightfully belongs under our control! The Reich also has their eye on this prize, but we must get to it first! Should the Czechs refuse, well, we have a long list of grievances with our former empire member."
 AUS_czechs_kneel:0 "Demand Czech Cooperation"
 AUS_czechs_kneel_desc:0 "Czechoslovakia once belonged to our empire, but now stand as middling state in Central Europe, abandoned by the west and looked at hungrily by its neighbors, torn apart by internal strife. They will once again submit to us, be it by paper or by blood."
 AUS_kill_ger:0 "Strike The Reich"
 AUS_kill_ger_desc:0 "The German Reich stands as a disgusting state ruled by the most abominable godless men. The Reich encourages worshipping the state and its leaders, not God. Neither do they show Christian mercy, killing rather than converting. The German people deserve better than this. Death to the Reich, long live Austria!"
 AUS_research_collab:0 "Research Collaberation"
 AUS_research_collab_desc:0 "Strong alliances bring with them many advantages, notably a good connection between the scientists."
 AUS_free_elections:0 "Re-Establish Free Elections"
 AUS_free_elections_desc:0 "Although our constitution has been re-written, it still provides for elections, although they have not been held due to extenuating circumstances. Time for that to change."
 AUS_false_corporatism:0 "Corporate in Name Only"
 AUS_false_corporatism_desc:0 "The situation in Austria is too tentative to trust the people in regards to picking their own representatives, regardless of the power of those representatives."
 AUS_join_allies:0 "Join the Allies"
 AUS_join_allies_desc:0 "At one time Britain refused to even speak to us about a guarantee, nevermind an alliance. The changed state of the world may now convince them otherwise."
 AUS_no_west:0 "Better Without the West"
 AUS_no_west_desc:0 "The western powers have spurned us again and again. Time that we simply ignore these so called "Great Powers" and turn our attentions elsewhere."
 AUS_reform_army:0 "Reform the Bundesheer"
 AUS_reform_army_desc:0 "Our army, the Bundesheer, stands unready to fight back against the Germans. They are underequipped, underfunded, and sympathetic to the enemy. This must change or we risk going down without a fight."
 AUS_mobile:0 "Doctrine of Mobility"
 AUS_mobile_desc:0 "The future of warfare is upon, and it relies upon rapid movement and quick reactions. The days of trench warfare have truly gone."
 AUS_static:0 "Doctrine of Defence"

 AUS_air_defence:0 "Anti-Air Defences"
 AUS_air_defence_desc:0 "Our Air Force will never be able to compete with Germany's. We should prepare for this in advance with ground-based anti-air units."
 AUS_mechanization:0 "Army Mechanization"
 AUS_mechanization_desc:0 "Our army looks far too much like an army from the Great War. We must modernize and mechanize our forces as quickly as possible."
 AUS_extra_doctrine:0 "Expand Doctrinal Thought"
 AUS_extra_doctrine_desc:0 "Now that we have determined the path that our army will take, we need to further our studies into our chosen doctrine. Simply knowing what we want to do is not enough, we must know how to do it as well."
 AUS_support_companies:0 "Support Companies"
 AUS_support_companies_desc:0 "Our armies need all of the help they can get, especially from the small specialized units that can make all the difference."
 AUS_light_tanks:0 "Rapid Armor"
 AUS_light_tanks_desc:0 "The most important part of a tank is its speed and mobility. Tanks that can appear from anywhere are worth their weight in gold."
 AUS_heavy_tanks:0 "Rolling Fortresses"
 AUS_heavy_tanks_desc:0 "Tanks can be used as literal fortresses, unflagging monsters of destruction that shrug off every hit and roll towards the enemy and their inexorable doom."
 AUS_panzers:0 "Austrian Panzers"
 AUS_panzers_desc:0 "Tanks are the future of combat. We should embrace this whole-heartedly."
 AUS_full_defence:0 "Reinfoce the Border"

 AUS_repudiate_germain:0 "Repudiate the Treaty of St. Germain"
 AUS_repudiate_germain_desc:0 "Our military advances have grown to the point that the Treaty of St. Germain now stands in name only. We should simply just publicly repudiate it, allowing us to act without going through the motions of acting according to the treaty."
 AUS_railway:0 "Electrify the Railways"
 AUS_railway_desc:0 "Switzerland has proved to us that electrified rail is the way of the future, yet we have been slow to adopt this innovation. It is time that we changed that."
 AUS_interconnect_rails:0 "Reintegrate the Railroads"

 AUS_good_steel_desc:0 "Austrian steel is in high demand around the world due to its quality and use in weaponry. We should expand production to meet global demands."
 AUS_armament:0 "Austrian Strong Arms"

 AUS_modern_tech:0 "Modern"
 AUS_hydroelectric:0 "Hydroelectric Possibilities"

 AUS:0 "New Technology Think Tanks"
 AUS_desc:0 "The world is rapidly changing. The time has come for us to make sure that we don't fall behind. The establishment of governmental think tanks who will reccommend to us new technologies and research them further should go a long way towards ensuring our technological competitiveness."
 AUS_think_tanks_desc:0 "The world is rapidly changing. The time has come for us to make sure that we don't fall behind.

 AUS_old_companies:0 "Imperial Companies"
 AUS_old_companies_desc:0 "Not every company collapsed when the empire did. We still have several large corporations with their headquarters in Austria, despite our diminished size. We must take advantage of this."
 AUS_old_mining:0 "Invest in Mining"
 AUS_old_mining_desc:0 "Produced goods come and go, but extracted raw materials are forever. We may have lost some of our best materials along with the empire, but thats not to say that we have none. We need to make sure that we can stay competitive in this regard on a global level. Investment into companies looking into advanced mining techniques should do the trick."
 AUS_airforce:0 "A New Airforce"
 AUS_airforce_desc:0 "Austria has not had the luxury until recently to look into rebuilding its air forces. We should begin to do so as soon as possible."
 AUS_aspern:0 "Aspern Aviation Barracks"
 AUS_aspern_desc:0 "Plans are useless if we do not have fields to take off or if we do not have the facilities to house them and their men. We should change this as swiftly as possible. A location has already been located in the 22nd district of Vienna."

 AUS_tullnerfeld:0 "Tullnerfeld Air Base"

 AUS_air_factories:0 "Expand Air Factories"

 AUS_dockyards:0 "Reimagined Imperial Dockyards"
 AUS_dockyards_desc:0 "We have done the impossible and gotten ourselves a shoreline. Luckily, we still have old plans for dockyards from our old imperial days. They just need to be updated a little."
 AUS_restore_navy:0 "Restoration"
 AUS_restore_navy_desc:0 "The old imperial navy focused heavily on large ships and crushing the enemy with sheer firepower. Luckily, things have not changed much in that department. Battleships, here we come!"
 AUS_reform_navy:0 "Reformation"
 AUS_reform_navy_desc:0 "The old imperial navy may have once been a strong power, but the old strategy of "build a bigger ship" sadly no longer works. A modern navy requires more than just that."

 AUS_destroyers_desc:0 "Destroyers form the backbone of any navy. We need to invest in them."
 AUS_heavy_cruisers:0 "Heavy Cruisers"
 AUS_heavy_cruisers_desc:0 "Cruisers provide excellent firepower for their production cost. We should invest in them."
 AUS_battleships:0 "Battleships"
 AUS_battleships_desc:0 "Some things never change. We should invest in large, heavy ships that destroy all they come into contact with. We are, of course, talking about battleships."
 AUS_submarines:0 "Undersea Warfare"
 AUS_submarines_desc:0 "The true danger of the seas lies below them, not upon them. Submarines hit hard, then simply dissappear into the murky depths of the ocean, only to resurface when least expected."
 AUS_marines:0 "Marines"
 AUS_marines_desc:0 "Our strength has generally been on the ground. So why not incorporate that into our naval technology as well?"
 AUS_carriers:0 "Aircraft Carriers"
 AUS_carriers_desc:0 "While the biggest ship might not always win in regards to firepower, this is certainly not the case for the new Aircraft Carriers. Ships so large that one can only marvel at them. Ships who bring death from the skies without firing a single shot. Truly, a marvel to behold, we must have one!"
 AUS_jagd:0 "Jagdkommandos"
 AUS_jagd_desc:0 "Our special services have been somewhat left out to dry since the end of the Great War. With out army finally back in fighting shape, its time that our special forces were as well."
